The repetition of the phrases and the funny little stories with accompanying pictures make for an ideal bedtime read. This isn't nearly as good as some of Sendak's other books (like Where the Wild Things are or Pierre: The Boy Who Didn't Care), but it still carries his unique brand of charm.\n",
      "9\n",
      "This is a wonderful little book. I loved it 40 years ago and my twins love it now. They enjoy helping me finish each month by singing \"... chicken soup with rice!\"<br /><br />The cute drawings add to the fun -- but be warned, one of them is very un-PC! We're not in 1962 any more, Toto.\n",
      "10\n",
      "One of my earliest memories is of this book.  My mother, who read to us constantly, read this one to us, and we quoted it non-stop.  In fact, that was a typical sort of soup we would beg for at the grocery because of this book!<br /><br />Since then, I have used the book in every class/teaching situation I have been in.  I have never met a child who did not LOVE it, and ask to be read it again and again.  It sure beats all those stupid songs you sing in preschool about the months of the year! :)  Even if you are not a Maurice Sendak fan, you will enjoy this one, because it is so original and poetic.\n",
      "13\n",
      "These days, when a person says, \"chicken soup\" they're probably going to follow up those words with, \"for the soul\" or maybe \"for the teenaged soul\".  Didn't used to be that way.  Why I can remember a time when if a person said, \"chicken soup\" those words were followed by an enthusiastic \"with rice!\".  Such was the power of Maurice Sendak's catchy 1962 children's book.  I am pleased to report that if you care to read this book again today, you will find it hasn't dimished a jot in terms of frolicksome fun.  In this book we are led through a whirlwind chicken soup year with our host, a boy who bears no little resemblance to Sendak's other great rhyming tale \"Pierre\" (in looks if not demeanor).  It's a catchy flouncy bouncy combo of soup and the people who love it so.<br /><br />This is ostensibly a book meant to teach your children the different months of the year.  Each month gets its own rhythmic poem and accompanying illustration.  These are fairly simple pen and ink drawings with the occasional splash of blue (in varying shades), yellow, gray, and green.  You may wonder how an author could ever hope to come up with twelve highly original soup-related poems.  I mean, honestly, how much is there to say about even the fanciest soup, let alone chicken soup with rice?  Quite a lot, as it happens.  In the cold winter months soup is supped while sliding on ice, while celebrating the birthday of a snowman, and in a gusty gale as a whale.  In the spring there's robin's nest soup, soup to cure drooping roses, and soup stolen by jealous March winds.  Our hero postulates the potential joys that could come of being a cooking pot, stewing soup or (oddly enough) as \"a baubled bangled Christmas tree\".<br /><br />Not to degrade the reading skills of parents everywhere, but I cannot recommend enough getting an audio version of this tale to accompany your child's reading.  Though I am now a wise and cultured 26 year-old (the years have been kind to me in this, my old age) I can still remember the chicken soup with rice tune.  Heck, I read this entire book recently and found I could do the song perfectly with each and every line.  Now maybe you have your own particular chicken soup with rice song style that you're just loathe to give up.  If so, fine.  I understand why you might not want to taint your already existing chicken soup melody.  But if you haven't found a jingle to accompany this book, get the audio version immediately, if not sooner.  Until you can sing \"Whoopy once, whoopy twice, whoopy chicken soup with rice\" with the correct oomph, you're missing out.<br /><br />I take my \"Chicken Soup With Rice\" readings seriously.  This book was the \"Chicka Chicka Boom Boom\" of its day, and still remains the catchiest method to teach kids the months of the year.  It is also seriously in danger of being forgotten.  So pull out your old accordion and strap on your dancing shoes.  The time for yukkin' it up to a merry dance of poultry broth is here.  It's Sendak at his finest.\n",

      "Summary:  A young boy describes the usefulness of chicken soup with rice for each month of the year.<br /><br />Evaluation:  With Sendak's creative repetitious and rhythmic words, children will enjoy and learn to read the story of a boy who loves chicken soup with rice!  Through Sendak's catchy story, children will also learn the months of the year, as well as what seasons go with what month! They learn to identify ice-skating and snowmen in the winter; strong wind in March; birds and flowers in the spring; swimming and hot temperatures in the summer; and finally different holidays throughout the year. Such as Halloween in October, and Christmas in December.<br /><br />Sendak's simple three colored crayon-like drawings are a perfect addition to his educational and entertaining story.<br /><br />A great activity that you can do with this book is to have children draw their own illustrations for each month of the year.  Afterwards you can bind the pages together so the children can create their own book.\n",

Well suited to 1.5 y/o old to 4+.<br /><br />Very few children's books are worth owning. Most should be borrowed from the library. This book, however, deserves a permanent spot on your shelf. Sendak's best.\n",

      "We have been using these dog treats for a long time.  The dogs love them a lot!  You cannot go wrong with these because they are all natural.<br />The only thing that I would say is a little disappointing about them is that some of the pieces are very small making them no good as treats.  You end up with liver \"dust\" when the larger pieces are used.  I generally take this \"dust\" and mix it into home made dog food for extra flavor.  Therefore, no product gets wasted.\n",

My dog goes nuts when he knows that he's about to be rewarded with<br />Pro-Treat Beef Liver treats. The instructions advise to give 2-3 pieces per day when using. At this rate, the container will last you a good while. The product itself is very fresh and the pieces are all of various sizes and thickness. Average size of treat is small rectangular pieces of different thickness. They're easy to break into smaller pieces if necessary. My Springer Spaniel pup is 5 months old and he just loves these. I tried this product on my girlfriend's 10 yr old teacup Poodle, who is pretty slow at this point in her life. She absolutely came to life and jumped all over the place for a taste of one of these treats. Buy it....your dog will love it!\n",

      "Freeze dried liver has a hypnotic effect on dogs. They LOVE it and will do just about anything for it, so it is a great treat to use for training. (Powdered freeze dried liver is even added to many dog medicines nowadays-- heartworm and arthritis tablets, etc.-- because it causes the dog to scarf the medicine down like a treat.)<br /><br />Freeze dried liver has a dry, hard, yet powdery/easy to chew consistency. It comes chopped/cubed. It is extremely lightweight due to the fact there is so little moisture in the product (thus the low weights on product labels).<br /><br />Even though your dog will love liver treats, you shouldn't overfeed it. The manufacturer recommends 1-2 cubes daily for small dogs, 2-3 cubes for medium dogs, and 3-4 cubes for large dogs.<br /><br />The largest package sizes of liver treats tend to be far more economical. I recommend buying the larger tubs, as you will save lots of money, you'll have a handy treat supply around for a longer time, and your dog will never tire of this product.<br /><br />There is really zero waste with this product. When you near the end of the tub you'll find some powdery bits of dried liver at the bottom. Your dogs will go CRAZY if you sprinkle this dust over their dog food-- it's a wonderful reward that is easy to use.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />Here's the nutritional analysis:<br /><br />-100% freeze dried liver<br />-NO additives or preservatives.<br /><br />-Crude protein..... not less than 50%<br />-Crude fat..... not less than 5%<br />-Crude fiber..... not more than 3%<br />-Moisture..... not more than 6%\n",
      "59\n",
      "My dog enjoys these treats in moderation.  Because they are dried, he seems to enjoy them less the more he eats them.  With water, the treats may be much more flavorful.  After having a fair amount, he starts to lose interest in them until he can drink.<br /><br />This brings me to a question regarding serving size.  The container recommends 2-3 cubes per day for a medium breed.  The issue I'm having is that the size of the cubes is so very inconsistent.  Some bits are the size of a pea while others of a grape.  The rest are a variety of sizes in between.  Some consistency would be preferred.<br /><br />Also, this product comes highly recommended for training because it is low in fat.  My dog certainly won't learn anything with just 2-3 of these per day.  Like most dogs, he is highly motivated by food so 20-30 treats is more accurate.  To make this possible, I have to dice them up into smaller pieces or shift through to find the little bits.<br /><br />At least these treats are natural and thus healthier than some of the other options.  I just didn't expect to have to prepare them first.\n",
      "60\n",
      "These are great training treats when you need something lightweight that won't make a mess of your pockets. I have a couple problems with them though. First, they are too expensive for every day training. Second, the sizes are so inconsistent that you need to cut some of the large cubes up (at this price, they should be ready-to-eat). Actually there is a third, which is that the powder leftover on the bottom is useless to me.<br /><br />I've found it much cheaper to just put some sliced beef liver from the store in the oven and bake till dry. Cut it up, put it in small portions, and freeze. My dog likes it better than the freeze-dried anyway. I do a whole bunch at a time so I am not prepping frequently. But I figure if I have to prep something, it might as well be something cheap!\n",
      "61\n",
      "My dog goes bonkers for these treats! They seem to be crazy delicious. Some of the pieces are so small, Lulu doesn't have to chew them; she seems to swallow them whole. I wonder how she even tastes them! But she must, because she whines and acts like a obnoxious brat every time I go near the bucket.<br /><br />I like that the treats don't have any additives. They really stink, though, and the smell stays on your fingers. The smell and the price are the only downsides. Also, I wish the container said how many calories the treats have so I could compare them to other natural treats like Fruitables. The vet said Lulu is getting fat (to which I replied \"Yo momma is fat!\") and that we should start watching her calories.<br /><br />If you're curious about the consistency of the size of the pieces, please see the photos I posted. There's some variation in size, and when I tip the bucket, I see more crumbly pieces at the bottom, but I don't foresee Lulu turning her nose up at them!\n",

      "My young Havapoo was very unhappy when I put him in his cage at night.<br />After I bought this product for him as a treat before going to bed, he is readily willing to enter his cage, munch a few little pieces of the dried liver and go to sleep quite happy. I can recommend this product to all pet lovers.\n",
      "64\n",
      "I buy a big tub of these for my dog about every 3-4 months. He loves them. I do mix them in with other treats, so he does not get a steady diet of them. They are given out as the \"special\" treat, being one notch above a standard, wheat-free dog cookie.<br /><br />While these are great treats, they are not as \"hypnotic\" as real meat is. And, given the price, and how inexpensive some good-quality meat is at the grocery store, if you truly want to mesmerize your dog, go with real meat. Its pretty funny that so many of us are paying $7-9 for little bags of dog treats when we could be buying real beef for about $4-5 a pound.<br /><br />However, most of us don't want slimy hands all day, so we use treats. I use these out when walking my dog, and carry them when we go out backpacking or on long day hikes. I like them because they are feather light, but just don't get them wet or they turn to mush. My dog's interest in them after they get wet goes down a lot.<br /><br />I do wish the pieces were more uniformly sized, but they aren't too hard to break apart.\n",

      "67\n",
      "I've been using these for my puppy with training and he absolutely loves them.<br /><br />The only inconvenience I find is that, while each piece varies greatly in size, they are pretty large.  So, I cut them up into pieces appropriate to the size practical for training.  Each time he gets one it is just a little piece, and that works great.<br /><br />Since I do cut them up, I don't find these to be expensive at all because they really go a long way.<br /><br />The other important thing is the list of ingredients.  They are not full of junk.  In fact, there is NO junk in them.  Just beef liver.  I like that, as I really try to know that I'm giving him good quality foods and treats.\n",

      "82\n",
      "I must say that my dog and all at the dog park LOVE these treats. Even the very fussy boxer sniffs at my pocket waiting for them. The sizes are quite variable which is ok.<br /><br />The product arrived with no protective covering on either the outside of the tub or under the lid which bothered me a bit (not sure if they had been open, returned by someone, then sent to us) so that is why I rated 3 stars.<br /><br />The amount of product for the price is great!<br />I would most likely purchase again.\n",
      "84\n",
      "My 4 month old aussie loves these! Whenever he's fixated on something (like another dog while we're on a walk), I quickly wave it near his head to redirect his attention. It's one of the only treats that can bring his focus back onto me. The other thing that works is hot dogs, but those aren't as easy to carry around as these freeze-dried pieces. Because of the power it has over my dog, I mainly only use these treats for special training sessions when I need a high value reward (e.g., for recall training). They aren't especially smelly, but some dogs can smell them yards away. I've been followed many times at the dog park by doggies that smell the leftover powder in my jacket pocket!<br /><br />The downside is that when I cut it into too small of a piece, it can crumble apart. Regardless, I think that these should definitely be diced down to a smaller size if one wants to use these treats as a training tool. The tub says that only a few should be fed per day, and it is to my understanding that too much liver isn't good for the dog. I've uploaded a picture of the feeding guidelines that are printed on the side of my 21oz tub and I'll also provide them here:<br />-------------------------------<br />Weight........................3 Times Daily<br />-------------------------------<br />10-30lbs....................1 to 2<br />30-60lbs....................2 to 4<br />over 60lbs..................4 to 6<br />-------------------------------<br /><br />So, for example, for a 60lb dog, about 4 pieces can be fed up to three times each day. Some people commented that only a couple can be fed to a large dog each day, but that information appears to be inconsistent with what is suggested on the tub. From my interpretation of the above table, the recommended daily amount is actually closer to a dozen than just a couple of pieces. I hope I'm not missing something here?<br /><br />I've also uploaded a photo of the front of the 21oz tub showing that it is made in the USA. It has a May 2, 2014 expiration date printed on the underside of the container.<br /><br />Hope this helps someone!\n",

My puppy absolutely adores these liver treats - our dog trainer calls them \"puppy heroin\". With these treats, training becomes an absolute snap, since the puppy is willing to do anything for his smelly liver treat - and you will have his undivided attention during the entire training session.<br /><br />These liver treats come in cubes and slices about a half inch on each side. I slice them thinly three or four time lengthwise, and then again two or three time crosswise. The liver treats fracture easily, and the taste is so addicting that only the tiniest slivers are necessary to reinforce good puppy behavior. These treats are also low fat and low preservatives, so they are very healthy for your puppy and that makes them even more perfect for training. Really, once you try this treat, you will never need another!<br /><br />As always, purchase and shipping from Amazon was easy and painless, and the liver treats were packed carefully enough that there was no extra treat breakage - which is remarkable for dried treats.<br /><br />~ Ana Mardoll\n",

      "I have a chihuahua that is the pickiest eater in the world!  I could not find any treat that this dog liked.  I finally tried the Pro-Treat Liver treats for dogs and she loves them!!  I actually have to give them to her at different times on different days, or she will get use to when she will get them.  Example, I was giving them to her when I got up every morning, so every morning she would wake me up at like 3:00 am so she could have a treat!<br /><br />These are the best treats and they are good for her!  It's a win win situation!\n",

      "Freeze dried liver has a hypnotic effect on dogs.  They LOVE it and will do just about anything for it, so it is a great treat to use for training.  (Powdered freeze dried liver is even added to many dog medicines nowadays-- heartworm and arthritis tablets, etc.-- because it causes the dog to scarf the medicine down like a treat.)<br /><br />Freeze dried liver has a dry, hard, yet powdery/easy to chew consistency.  It comes chopped/cubed.  It is extremely lightweight due to the fact there is so little moisture in the product (thus the low weights on product labels).<br /><br />Even though your dog will love liver treats, you shouldn't overfeed it.  The manufacturer recommends 1-2 cubes daily for small dogs, 2-3 cubes for medium dogs, and 3-4 cubes for large dogs.<br /><br />The largest package sizes of liver treats tend to be far more economical.  I recommend buying the larger tubs, as you will save lots of money, you'll have a handy treat supply around for a longer time, and your dog will never tire of this product.<br /><br />There is really zero waste with this product.  When you near the end of the tub you'll find some powdery bits of dried liver at the bottom.  Your dogs will go CRAZY if you sprinkle this dust over their dog food-- it's a wonderful reward that is easy to use.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />Here's the nutritional analysis:<br /><br />-100% freeze dried liver<br />-NO additives or preservatives.<br /><br />-Crude protein..... not less than 50%<br />-Crude fat.....  not less than 5%<br />-Crude fiber.....  not more than 3%<br />-Moisture.....  not more than 6%\n",

      "I have ordered these a number of times for my terrier mix (part pit bull?) - usually a little cheaper than in-store.  I initially used them for training only and then found that with the larger pieces I could jam a piece or two inside a chew toy, hide a treat toy or hollow bone that has already stood Travis' test and this can give my dog hours of enjoyment.<br /><br />My issue with them - and why I went with a 4 instead of a 5 - is the size of the pieces are inconsistent.  My first couple times there was a good mix of some larger squares - 3/4\" - 1\" cubes and smaller that I use for training bits.  My last order was completely smaller pieces - making it difficult to use it inside a toy/ bone as they come out too easily. Play time no longer lasts as long.<br /><br />I am hopeful that my next order in line with the others and have a mix. I would have given it a 5 prior to my last order.<br /><br />As a training treat these are AMAZING.\n",

      "Pros:<br />Dog will do anything for this treat.<br />Doesn't smell as bad as many other treats.<br />Easy to break into smaller pieces.<br />Nothing artificial, easy digestion.<br /><br />Cons:<br />More costly than other dog treats.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great product. While more expensive, my dog will do anything for this treat. He has several phobias, including getting in and out of the car, and walking through doorways, but he ignores all of his fears to get to this treat.\n",

      "Dogs love these treats more than any other treats I've ever found.  In situations where other treats fail to get our dog's attention - <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0019O5Z0Q\">Charlee Bear Turkey Liver & Cranberry Flavored Dog Treats</a>, for example - these treats are impossible for her to ignore.  They are an incredible training aid.<br /><br />Big bonus is that they're also simple and good for the dog.  Liver is a healthy treat and is supposed to help combat weepy eyes.  Unlike most other commercial treats, this one isn't loaded with a bunch of other junk that isn't good for your dog (byproducts and the like), it's just a good ingredient that your dog will love.\n",

      "Getting grain free treats for training usually leaves three options: hard biscuits (and who wants to work for those?), cooked meat (which is gross to handle), or commercial meaty grain-free treats which cost an arm and a leg.<br /><br />These on the other hand, are very affordable, not gross to handle, and the dogs think they smell AMAZING.  They work great when your dog's attention is wavering - a waff of freeze dried beef liver usually snaps them back to attention!<br /><br />Also, being as they're only beef liver, I don't feel bad feeding my dog as many as needed for training.<br /><br />Highly recommended.\n",

      "My dog trainer recommended this to our obedience class. I found the best price here on Amazon, and my puppy LOVES the treats. Great training treats if used in moderation (too much organ meat isn't good for anyone). Also excellent if you put some of the treats in a container with non-liver treats/cookies. Use the container as a shaker to help train your dog to come, and the other treats get a liver flavored (dust) coating that makes your dog love them even more!

Dogs, cats and ferrets are carnivores they are not cattle to eat grain or rabbits to eat vegetables, and WHYYYY do companies add sugar,beet pulp or corn syrup to carnivore foods? It is dangerous and can cause the death of an animal with diabetes.<br />It is pretty easy to break into smaller pieces for cats and kittens with weak jaws and its wonderful to use as an aid to gain the trust of an abused dog as it will not cause stomach upset when given in common sense amounts.<br />I like that it goes a long way as it costs alot to heal and maintain and train abused and rescued dogs.<br />NO minus to this product other then the price,I can not afford to use it as much as I would like.\n",

I must have gotten some funky soil because as soon as I repotted, we were being overrun by a large colony of small flies. I was swatting them and getting bug guts on my hand so frequently I stopped bothering with the \"gross!\" exclamations. The fact that in the city of San Francisco, you have to compost just aggravated the situation.<br /><br />I bought one of these nitfy traps and set it by my plant and voila! Instead of my hands getting the daily dose of bug guts, the trap is now lined with the tiny suckers! It's been a few months and the trap is pretty much covered (the gross part) and I need to order another one.

      "I'm getting crazy.I'm looking for Beatlejuice french version video.<p>Is it really impossible today not to find the French VHS version of this film ?<p>Could U please tell me something about it ? Tks\n",
      "226\n",
      "I grew up with this movie.  At first I thought it had no plot, and was just a series of gross random events where Beetlejuice does bad stuff.  Now I realize that it does have a plot, and a very good one.  I don't recall any other movie where ghosts have trouble trying to scare living people out of a house and have to hire another ghost who claims to be an expert.  However, after this set-up happens, THAT'S when the movie becomes a series of gross random events where Beetlejuice does bad stuff.<br /><br />Whenever someone mentions Beetlejuice, I think of nothing else but all the weird stuff that's in it.  For instance, when the ghosts try to leave the house, they wind up in some crazy desert place where giant sandworms threaten to eat them.  The movie doesn't do a great job of explaining where this place is, but I think it's the planet Saturn.  Needless to say, since the ghosts can't leave their house, it definitely motivates them to scare away the living people moving in (a bunch of weirdos by the way, so that provides some extra incentive)<br /><br />Then there's the lost souls room, the guy stretching out his head to look like some sort of chicken, the shrimp cocktail turning into hands, Beetlejuice living in a model of the city, the chalk-drawn door opening up to a portal, and the moving art statues.  This movie is just flat-out bizarre.  There's so much that's packed into it.<br /><br />But its kind of a downer that the afterlife is shown as some kind of overly-administrative going to and fro, where you have to read a handbook, wait in an office, talk to a case worker, and do all other kinds of boring things.<br /><br />Here's the kicker.  I work in a funeral home, and this movie STILL grosses me out.  Walking dead folks are all over the place.  Some sawn in half, others flattened by a truck, and Beetlejuice himself looks to have some kind of mild skin decomposition.  But by far the scene that's hardest to stomach is the seance.  The ghosts are summoned in their wedding outfits only to grow older and older until they start to fall apart.  I should be thankful that they weren't shown as green and bloated throughout the whole movie, since drowning's the thing that killed them.<br /><br />This is one of the most original and disgusting films you'll ever see.  I think everybody should see it once, just to see how bizarrely creative it is.  Obviously a whole heck of a lot of work went into it.  Beetlejuice himself made me laugh quite a bit, with lines like, \"Attention K-Mart shoppers!\" but he sure did gross me out a lot too.<br /><br />I kind of wish Burton would have stayed away from the Halloween type movies and did more stuff like Pee-Wee's Big Adventure.  I've been wanting to see Big Fish for a while, but I heard its not very good.\n",

      "This is one of my most favorite movies. I'm ashamed at my self. Because it took me so long to finally get it on DVD.

      "It was on the other night, and, having been a big fan of the cartoon when it was being shown, decided to watch it (I'm also trying to see all the Winona Ryder movies I know.). <p> It's a well known fact i like seeing her [Winona Ryder] dance at the end of a movie (hey, it's funny!), but apart from that, it was just a hilarious film and i liked it very much. The only thing  wrong was that it was too short. Maybe the special efects were a bit &quot;off&quot;, but hey, it's an older movie1\n",

      "I must agree with the few people who complained that this dvd was lacking in special features and whatnot. However, if you have never seen the movie at all, or enjoyed the movie but do not already have a copy, it's still a good buy. It's a great movie, no matter how it's presented on the dvd, and you do get a few episodes of the cartoon as well. I watched Beetlejuice as a kid, both the movie and the cartoons, so I probably would've bought it even if it was a poorly recorded VHS :) In short, don't expect it to be \"deluxe\", but I definitely recommend buying it (unless you already have a standard version of it).<br /><br />As for the movie itself, if you've never seen it, it's basically a ghost story that is purposely presented in a cheesy manner to be funny. If you're familiar with Tim Burton at all, you'll know he tends to stray from the norm. Don't expect to be scared; that's not what this movie is about. It's basically about a nice couple of ghosts who try to scare away the family who lives in their house, but the family isn't scared; in fact, they invite other people over and try to show off the ghosts - so the ghost couple hires a... rather disgusting guy to help them out, and things pretty much go downhill from there. Definitely and old 80s classic.\n",

      "Of all the movies that Tim Burton did, there are three names that come out a lot during discussions. Of course his two Batmans, then his masterpiece Edward Scissorhands,  but most of all his excellent comedy Beetlejuice. Why's that? Because as a society where we usually consider the after-life as a dark and depressing world, Tim Burton presents death in a different perspective. He represents it as an extremely funny world where people become ghosts stuck in their own houses and are haunted by the living, a world where death is a huge bureaucracy, and a world where there are bio-exorcists, like the one and only Mr. Beetlejuice. Although this is a movie where the main characters are Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis, and they do an excellent job as a recently dead-couple, it's Michael Keaton who deserves the spotlight. For each time he appears on the screen, he just makes you laugh with his funny one-liners (excellent improvisation from Michael Keaton) and his perfect interactions with his co-stars such as Sylvia Sidney, Winona Ryder, Glenn Shaddix, Jeffrey Jones, and Catherine O`Hara, all future collaborators during Tim Burton`s career. Everyone, and I mean everyone, delivers a perfect performance.<br /><br />Not only that it is a movie that has excellent visual effects, both traditional and with the computer. Also, I loved how they were able to integrate gorgeous stop-motion animations during the movie. They were well integrated in the movie and are a proof that this kind of animation can really bring great possibilities to a movie, though there are certain limits to it of course. But hey, that also counts for CGI too.<br /><br />Finally, a great cheer to Danny Elfman, whose soundtrack really gave him the popularity and respect he deserved. A great idea from the makers of this DVD to integrate the soundtrack as a separate audio track.<br /><br />In the end, a great classic that should be listened over and over again and being considered a classic of modern american cinema.\n",

      "After 20 years, this oddball dark comedy hasn't lost its irreverent impact. Up-and-coming director Tim Burton's playfully twisted visual style runs rampant through this movie, saturating nearly every frame. It even turns actor Michael Keaton into sort of a vile living cartoon, the one & only Beetlejuice, a manic bio-exorcist with sinister agendas. The film also boosted the resumes of terrific talents like Jeffrey Jones & Catherine O'Hara (here as an annoying trendy couple transplanted from New York to a small Connecticut town). The film helped maked stars of Geena Davis & Alec Baldwin (as the kind, hapless ghostly couple) and Winona Ryder (as the ex-New Yorker's death-obsessed daughter, Lydia). But this is really Keaton's movie all the way, in spite of a good cast.<br />The art direction, make-up & special effects have Burton's distinctive stamp all over them.<br />I was slightly disappointed that this 20th Anniversary Edition didn't have at least interviews or a making-of featurette (although it includes a handful of the delightful \"Beetlejuice\" animated episodes).<br />However, it's a little offbeat comedy that's achieved cult status over the years (all you have to do is view it to figure out why). Just don't say the title three times!\n",
      "253\n",
      "Here is a movie that is top notch in a lot of ways. It's a great family movie. Some may not agree, but I say it is. Adults will understand it more but kids will love the colorful creatures, even though several aspects of the film will fly right over their heads. Tim Burton really hit the button here on his unique style of filmaking, and really never did it better, even with the number of great films he's waxed his style all over through the years.<br /><br />The story starts with Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis as \"The Recently Deceased.\"  They have to learn how to be ghosts, and it's not easy. That is why there is a department dedicated to helping their cause, however, it is as backed up as an inner city welfare office. This is why sleazy swindlers such as the title character come around, dedicated to taking advantage of their delicate situation.<br /><br />When our ghosts discover that they have to share their small town dream home, with some living artsy-fart aristocrats, it's more then they can bare. SO, as most ghosts would do in this situation, they decide to scare the new tennants away. However, their obvious inexperience proves as a pitfall. Especially since these a*holes get a kick out of it, and start using them as party favors. Enter Michael Keaton as Beedle Geuss (He needs somebody to pronounce his name right).  The couple, desperate, go against the wishes of the department and hire him, to give the new tennants a proper scare. Although they soon realize that they may have gotten in too far over their heads with this ghoul.<br /><br />Lydia, played by Winonna Ryder, is the disillusioned daughter of the artsys and she somehow naturally communicates with the dead, and becomes a friend to the couple. Naturally she becomes the prime target for Beetlejuice also (If I was a sleazy ghoul, I would be all over her too!) and thats when things get ugly. But don't worry too much, because in the end everyone figures out how to compromise, and dance around the house to the tune of Shake Senora. The comedic icing of the whole demented cake.<br /><br />This movie works just as well as a comedy, as it does a terrific ghost story. The effects are great, and a symbol to what made Tim Burton so cool early in his career (who can forget those claymation sand serpents?) The score is perfectly creepy, and this thing is just an all around great movie. Good stuff for the Halloween film fest peeps. I pull it out all the time!\n",

Outstanding job to Winona Ryder as Lydia, the misunderstood teen ager who no one appears to understand.<br /><br />I give this movie two thumbs up, one scene in particular that still cracks me up is when they brought back the couple, Alex's character begins to speak and his jaw falls off... not to forget the beloved scene when Beetlejuice is sitting next to the Witch Doctor and steals his number, the head shrinking scene is just too funny for words.\n",

      "Oh, snap, that's right, Alec Baldwin once upon a time was svelte, as so documented in BEETLEJUICE, the 1988 film that - along with CLEAN AND SOBER - made a case for Michael Keaton having a streak dark and dangerous enough to qualify him for the then upcoming Batman role.<br /><br />It can be tough when you're newly shuffled off that mortal coil, tough when the shelf life exceeds the expiration date. Adam and Barbara Maitland (Baldwin and Geena Davis) - a young couple in love - are freshly minted ghosts who find themselves confined to their quaint New England home, and they seem content enough with their new sitch. But when a family of obnoxious artsy-fartsy New Yorkers move into their house and threatens to annihilate their peace of mind, the Maitlands may have no recourse but to contract that shady freelance \"bio-exorcist\" Betelgeuse. Certainly, the Handbook for the Recently Deceased isn't much help. Adam and Barbara's irascible case worker Juno - who is supposed to ease them into the afterlife - worsens things by remarking that the Maitlands must spend 125 years on Earth in their house before they can move on. Anyway, it's a delectable twist, this meek and retiring ghostly couple being haunted - and bullied - by the living. BEETLEJUICE, as if you didn't know, is a hugely entertaining supernatural comedy. Harry Belafonte's catchy calypso music simply acts as a bonus.<br /><br />The Maitlands' bridge to the living is Winona Ryder's appealingly strange little goth girl, Lydia Deetz. Lydia is pretty much the only \"house guest\" that Adam and Barbara can tolerate and they, in turn, become surrogate parents to Lydia whose real parents (a shrill Catherine O'Hara, a distracted Jeffrey Jones), let's face it, tend to neglect her to bits. Lydia demonstrates an unnatural awareness of the ghostly Maitlands, and it's her curiosity which helps propel a major plot point - namely, Betelgeuse's getting his hooks into the Maitlands. Adam and Barbara prove to be too mild-mannered and just too nice to put a proper fright into the Deetzes - their idea of scaring the mortals is to possess them and make them dance to Harry Belafonte. Conversely, Betelgeuse embodies equal traits of perversity and meanness and he right away cows the Deetzes; the Deetzes' family friend, Otto, especially has it coming. But then we learn that Betelgeuse has his own nasty end game in mind, with no one but the Maitlands and the spunky little girl, Lydia, to thwart him. As likable as Baldwin and Davis are, Michael Keaton's awesomely manic, joke-a-second performance fuels the movie. He injects just enough demonic chops to come across as a sinister adversary.<br /><br />Director Tim Burton put Hollywood on notice with PEE-WEE'S BIG ADVENTURE, and BEETLEJUICE only expanded his street creds. BEETLEJUICE exhibits Burton's bag of tricks - the distinctive style, the touch of artistic creativity, that smidge of the surreal and the fantastic. There's a lot of visual treats, ranging from the storybook look of the Maitland home to the bizarre architecture of the offices of the supernatural underworld. The dazzlingly inventive sight gags add to the film's offbeat humor. That waiting room is almost as diverting as the Star Wars cantina in terms of ambiance and their inhabitants. All in all, BEETLEJUICE is an astonishing, demented spin on the classic ghost story. Exorcism has never been more fun... or backwards.<br /><br />So this DVD is The 20th Anniversary Deluxe Edition and offers these paltry bonus features:<br /><br />- 3 BEETLEJUICE Cartoon Episodes: \"A-Ha!\", \"Skeletons in the Closet,\" & \"Spooky Boo-tique\"<br />- the option to watch the film in Music-Only Track<br />- Theatrical Trailers for BEETLEJUICE and PEE-WEE'S BIG ADVENTURE\n",

      "Beetlejuice is a movie I consider to be one of Tim Burton's best movies. I also consider it to be one of those kind of movies that could have come out only in the 80s (much like Labyrinth starring David Bowie and Jennifer Connelly).<br /><br />Beetlejuice deals with a recently deceased married couple, the Maitlands, who finds themselves essentially \"trapped\" in their former house for the next century or so. Unfortunately, this means living with the house's new owners, the Deetz. The Maitlands don't mind Deetz daughter Lydia played by Winona Ryder so much but her much more obnoxious parents and want to scare them away from the house. Their case worker tells them only one thing: to NEVER even think about recruiting her former assistant Beetlejuice. Unfortunately, they manage to resist for a while before giving in and Beetlejuice causes nothing but problems.<br /><br />It's definitely a work by Tim Burton. His ever-present \"uniqueness\" and charm is there. Beetlejuice is a fun 80s movie and a very fun watch period. the acting by everyone involved in the movie is great (especially Michael Keaton as Beetlejuice). The make-up for the necessary characters were well done and the \"afterlife\" set designs and make-up there were great. I loved the make-up and designs in the afterlife scenes.<br /><br />The movie itself is great and I would have given it five stars. The blu-ray as a whole leaves a little to be desired. It's one of those DVDs or blurays that pretty much leaps right into the movie. No title screen, scene selection, anything. This was a bit annoying since I had to manually go skip through the whole movie to get back to where I left off the night before. There's a small handful of special features that you may or may not be interested in. The special features are only three episodes of the cartoon series (of which I watched as a kid) and an audio track. The special features it does have really aren't that bad, I would have just liked to have had more. Like some sort of commentary, deleted scenes, or something.<br /><br />All in all, five stars for movie itself and three for the blu-ray (averaging four stars).\n",

      "This has been my favorite movie since I was a little kid. I used to watch it every day! It has perfect casting. This movie has a little of everything-comedy, drama, horror(well sorta).<br /><br />Definitly a must see!<br /><br />~silence~\n",

      "At the time of its release in 1988, 'Beetlejuice' was a huge hit. Although it does seem a little dated now, it still has some wonderful visual jokes (especially the characters in the waiting room). The laughs begin with the main characters' deaths after only 10 minutes. They look expectantly at a little dog who is balancing their car on a plank of wood over the edge of a bridge. He tip-toes off and they fall to their deaths. The film is full of satirical vignettes e.g. the after-life is managed by a number of desk clerks who have condemned themselves to an eternity as civil servants because they committed suicide. The Deetz's interior designer Otho is unafraid of all the ghoulish horrors that surround him, but yet finds himself in his most frighteneing moment when Betelguise removes his designer suit to reveal a 70's pastel leisure suit and he runs in terror.<p>Apparently director Tim Burton loved making the film as Warners stayed off his back for most of it, so he had greater freedom to improvise with the actors and the story. Half-way through its making, he didn't know how it was going to end. The stop-motion techniques might look a little dated but Burton was a big fan of Godzilla as a child.\n",

      "Beetlejuice is an awe-inspiring wonderfully amusing comedic romp that explores the incredible possibilities of the after-life and the boundaries of the absurd. Telling the tale of a recently dead married couple that suddenly gets led into the chaotic world of the supernatural. Adam and Barbara Maitland (Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis) discover many of the conflicting rather human imperfections that haunt the lives of the living also plague the afterlife as well.<p>Unlike some film projects that seemed to be blindly assigned to dispassionate filmmakers for commercial reasons, Beetlejuice's plot and bizarre subject matter remarkably complemented Burton's unusually macabre artistic sensibilities extraordinarily well. Created by the unbelievably brilliant guidance of imaginative film director, Tim Burton (Pee Wee's Big Adventure, Batman, Ed Wood, Sleepy Hollow). The film's uniquely creative landscape was a culmination of essentially all of the abundant irony and outlandish yet human behaviors that have graced the body of Burton's work.<p>Augmented by deviously energetic performances from Glenn Shadix, Jeffrey Jones, Winona Ryder, Catherine O' Hara, Geena Davis, and Alec Baldwin, the film bustles with uninhibited brilliant hilarity that persistently pushes the film to a level of almost affable euphoria. Paired with its ingenious screenplay and a tour de force performance by Michael Keaton as Beetlejuice. This film transforms itself into an exuberant jovial exercise that is extremely satisfying and philosophically perceptive on many levels. Though comedy is usually considered to be unable or undeserving of deep critical analysis, Beetlejuice is an undeniably inspired concept that has been flawlessly transferred to film. One of the most outstanding comedies of the 1980's. <p>As for the film's DVD package, the DVD includes the theatrical trailer, an isolated Danny Elfman musical track, and the choice to watch the film in anamorphic widescreen or Pan and Scan. Hopefully Beetlejuice will eventually be graced with a special edition. We can always hope.\n",

      "I have the DVD, and added the Blue-Ray.  A very good movie.  It is very re-watchable. It's also a good opportunity to view some famous actors in much younger days.  A much younger Alec Baldwin is hardly recognizable. Michael Keaton really isn't recognizable due to the makeup used, even though he played a great part.  Wynona Ryder plays a great part as always.  Gina Davis and Catherine O'Hara played their parts well.  Although the PQ was very good, I really didn't see any appreciable improvement in the PQ or Audio, over the earlier DVD.  I have a 5.1 system, with Polk Speakers.<br /><br />There is only one disc. There was no paper insert. The separate audio soundtrack (on the same Blue-Ray disc), failed to play on my Panasonic BD60 (with all firmware updates). Everything else played.  If you have the DVD, I don't see any benefit in getting the Blue-Ray.  I guess that's why the price dropped to close to single digits.  I'm really starting to question the benefits of Blue-Ray over DVDs.  In most Blue-Ray movies, I've watched, extras, present on earlier releases, have been removed.  I thought that was a major selling point in the Blue-Ray movement.\n",

      "Beetlejuice is the story of ghosts (Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis) who can't get along with the family (Jeffrey Jones, Catherine O'Hara, and Winona Ryder) that moves into their house. The ghosts enlist Beetlejuice (Michael Keaton) to help them, and the fun really starts. The movie is directed by Tim Burton. Robert Goulet and Dick Cavett make cameos. The score is by Danny Elfman. This movie has a great cast and a great director. <p>If you're a fan of Burton's other movies, you'll especially like this movie. Like all his movies, it has his distinctive look and feel to it. But anyone can enjoy this far-fetched comedy. Being PG, it should be appropriate for most members of the family. The DVD is lacking some of the special features that I would like to see though - like outtakes, behing-the-scenes, etc...\n",

      "Beetlejuice is a very Tim Burtonesque Tim Burton movie, establishing his fascination with the macabre and, especially in this case, the funny, campy side of death and horror.  It's the story of a newly dead couple (Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin) who are essentially stuck as ghosts in their house, and don't like its new owners (parents Jeffrey Jones and Catherine O'Hara and daughter Winona Ryder).  They enlist the help of a more experienced, half-crazy but very insistent ghost, Beetlejuice (Michael Keaton), in an effort to scare the new owners away by haunting them.  Beetlejuice turns out to have his own agenda, and alliances shift as the story winds through learning to be dead, afterlife bureaucracy, wild chases through small spaces, Calypso dancing at dinner to Harry Belafonte's \"Banana Boat Song\" (\"Day-O\"), a very goth wedding ceremony, and supernatural comeuppance.<br /><br />The cast, for the most part, is perfectly suited to the wacky material, the sets and make-up and other effects very imaginative, the story engaging.  Great fun.<br /><br />This new release is being marketed as the 20th Anniversary Deluxe Edition.  It will be newly remastered, but the extras announced so far are very limited: three episodes of the Saturday morning Beetlejuice cartoon series (\"Skeletons in the Closet,\" \"Spooky Boo-tique,\" \"A-Ha!\"), a music-only track, and the trailer.  The cartoons are about 11 minutes each.  Possibly more features will be announced later, but usually that doesn't happen.  I've subtracted one star for the poor features in a \"deluxe\" anniversary edition; if they announce more features I may up my rating.  The best thing is likely to be the remastering, which is needed, since the older DVD wasn't all the great.  Looking forward to that.\n",

      "Tim Burton had come off the blockbuster success of his first feature film PEE-WEE'S BIG ADVENTURE (1985) when he was greenlighted by Warner Bros. to direct the project he REALLY wanted to make. It was the picture that would define the rest of his career to this day: the supernaturally weird black comedy (and weirdly-titled) BEETLEJUICE (1988). It was so unique, so strange to me that I didn't know what to make of it when I first saw it on video in 1989. I remember from that first time liking parts of it, but not liking the picture as a whole. The movie was so frenetic, so odd in its mixture of Goth Horror, Comedy, gruesome visual effects (I'm still kind of amazed that it got a PG rating instead of PG-13) and cartoonish slapstick that I really didn't know what to make if it. Well, now that I've seen it at least a half-dozen times since (three of them in the past year alone), I can say that it has held up better than many of the most popular 80's films (TOP GUN, etc) and has become a classic all unto itself.<p>With BEETLEJUICE, Tim Burton showed not only that he could direct effective comedy and illicit inspired performances from his actors, but also bring a true artist's touch to the big screen. Of course, the film won the Oscar for Best Makeup (as if there was any real question about it), but I also think that it should have also been at least nominated for Visual Effects and Art Direction, as those truly mesmerizing aspects all come together to create a product that is so unique. Not only that, but this film helped make the careers of several actors who would go on to major success soon after.<p>Two of those actors are Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis, as the ill-fated newlyweds Adam and Barbara Maitland who, after buying a big Victorian dream house at the film's outset, die in a bizarre car accident soon after. Slowly realizing that they've passed on to the next world, they don't want to give up their house to the pathetically bourgeois Charles &amp; Delia Deetz (Jeffrey Jones &amp; Catherine O'Hara), who along with their chubby, effete chauffeur Otho (Glenn Shadix) have already moved in, and inspire true disgust in the newly-dead couple. However, they seem to have an ally in the older couple's death-obsessed Goth daughter Lydia (Winona Ryder) see an afterlife advertisement for a &quot;Bio-Exorcist&quot; named Betelgeuse (Michael Keaton) and decide that their only hope in driving out the destestable Charles, Delia, and Otho is in using the wild, unpredictable Betelgeuse. Of course, good ol' Betelgeuse will gladly provide his unique brand of service, but at a very high price. <p>Alec Baldwin &amp; Geena Davis fill their roles very well. The ironic thing is that this was the first film I'd ever seen Alec Baldwin in, so my first impression of him as the nerdy, good-natured Adam ended up being turned around by 180 degrees by the psychotic, tough-guy roles that would define the rest of his career. That turnabout came pretty quickly, actually, as the very next film I would see him in was MARRIED TO THE MOB (1988), in which he was a mobster unbeknownst to his wife who gets offed early on, but it was his psychotic turn in the extremely quirky and violent MIAMI BLUES (1989) that really shocked me and made me realize that Alec really had some range to him (unfortunately, he would be end up being typecast as psychos for the rest of his career). However, Geena Davis, herself at the cusp of stardom (and Oscar acclaim) is playing pretty much the quirky kind of character that would eventually define her career. In fact, it was just the following year that she would win the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress for playing the truly quirky and inspired Muriel Pritchett in the otherwise uninspired THE ACCIDENTAL TOURIST (1989). This film, of course, also boosted the career of the now-infamous Winona Ryder, who quickly became the hot new &quot;it&quot; girl in the late 80's with this movie and with others soon to follow: 1969 (1988), HEATHERS (1989), GREAT BALLS OF FIRE! (also 1989), EDWARD SCISSORHANDS (1990, and another Tim Burton film) and MERMAIDS (also 1990). Of course, former AMADEUS (1984) emperor and FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF (1986) principal Jeffrey Jones, now infamous for his own reasons, is also terrific here, as is former &quot;SC-TV&quot; alumnus Catherine O'Hara. We also get a welcome supporting performance from the great old character actress, Sylvia Sidney, as the chain-smoking receptionist Juno!<p>But it was Michael Keaton, who was already an up-and-coming comedic actor known for quirky hit comedies such as the Ron Howard-directed NIGHT SHIFT (1982), MR. MOM (1983), JOHNNY DANGEROUSLY (1984) and GUNG HO (1986), who really stole the show and hit paydirt in the process. He would immediately be elevated to &quot;A&quot; list status with his truly brilliant, maniacal and hilarious performance as the titular Betelgeuse, going immediately on to bigger &amp; better things with Tim Burton himself, starring soon after as BATMAN (1989)! It's funny; I think that in 1988, Keaton was robbed of Oscar nominations not only for this truly unique comedic role, but for also his surprising dramatic turn as a recovering alcoholic in CLEAN AND SOBER. It just shows that, for whatever reason, comedians just don't get recognized enough for their acting ability.<p>BEETLEJUICE is a lot of fun. It looks like it must have been a lot of fun to make. Despite the liberal PG rating, I would recommend it only for ages 9 &amp; up, as the humor is quite adult and the rather gruesome visuals are likely to give any young child nightmares. It is still a truly unique movie with incredible special effects, and it still makes me laugh to this day. Oddly enough, whenever I see it, it makes me that much less afraid to die!<p>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED\n",

This movie is hilariously funny, but at the same time it has a touch of drama in it. It's an all around great movie.<p>Michael Keaton does an excellent job of playing the odd, funny, and perverted Beetlejuice who causes quite the chaos with a newly deceased couple, Adam and Barbara. Let me just say no one and I mean NO ONE could've been better for the part of Beetlejuice.<p>The only disapointting thing about the DVD Beetljuice is there were no deleted scenes or extra footage.. I was disapointed, but I love this movie so much it was still worth it!<p>If you haven't seen Beetlejuice, then YOU MUST SEE IT.

      "Michael Keaton was already on his way to being a major star when he played the ghost with the most in \"Beetlejuice.\" His performance in the title role simply solidified his status as one of Hollywood's brightest comedy stars.<p>Now, years later, this film still generates the same belly laughs that it did when it was first released. Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis have fun in their roles as husband and wife who are surprised to find themselves dead, but they are merely window-dressing for Keaton's centerpiece. The only complaint here is that there are a few too many gross-out gags, but that is something which has come to define many of director Tim Burton's films. Still, the movie is a lot of fun from beginning to end, and it's worth considering adding it to your video collection.\n",

      "Re-watching Beetlejuice more than a decade after it thrilled, frightened and enthralled me as a child makes me sad about Mr. Tim Burton's transformation into a Hollywood favorite semi-quirky remake-director (Planet Of The Apes, Sleepy Hollow) in recent years (Big Fish indeed signals a hopeful recovery - if only Charlie And The Chocolate Factory doesn't spoil it...!) At the young age of thirty, and in only his second full length feature, Burton created a cult favorite that is one for the ages. In this bizarre, off-beat script by Michael McDowell (who collaborated with him before on an episode of the `Alfred Hitchcock Presents' television series) he found the ideal vehicle for his unique and strange imagination - and indeed, Burton's unique vision is more apparent here than in any of his movies, The Nightmare Before Christmas being the happy exception. Though it's true that it's not as personal a creation as `Nightmare' or Edward Scissorhands, this is the movie that would place Burton on the map as a major director, and would earn him his breakthrough job - directing the first Batman feature film. It is on Beetlejuice that he would also start several long-time collaborations with actors who would work with him again in the future - Michael Keaton (Batman &amp; Batman Returns), Winona Ryder (Edward Scissorhands), Jeffrey Jones (Ed Wood, Sleepy Hollow), Glenn Shadix and Catherine O'Hara (both of whom did voiceovers for Nightmare Before Christmas).<p>So, again, while Beetlejuice isn't as deep and personal film as we would see in Nightmare Before Christmas, Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood or Big Fish, Beetlejuice is an incredibly imaginative and captivating film and is a perfect black comedy. Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin are both more than adequate, but Michael Keaton in the title part is of course the real star of the show - although in reality his part is much smaller than those of Davis and Baldwin. Keaton is electric and mesmerizing as the bio-exorcist or `the Ghost with the Most', Beetlejuice (spelled BETELGEUSE!), probably the greatest and most memorable performance of his career (with the possible exception of the part of Batman). Keaton really let loose in Beetlejuice, and he and Burton were seemingly having a blast - they created one of the most memorable horror and comedy characters on the big screen. Seventeen year old Winona is also terrific as Goth-girl Lydia, fascinated and repulsed by Betelgeuse's extreme personality. Similarities between her character here and the one in Edward Scissorhands are easy to find, but for my money her performance as Lydia is the better one.<p>And in conclusion, if there's any movie that I'd recommend to own on VCR or DVD, it's Beetlejuice; because Burton at his best made films that are well rewarding in repeated viewing, and Beetlejuice is Burton at his very, very best, even if it's not his best film. So even if it's not an essential masterpiece like Edward Scissorhands, Beetlejuice is one of the classic cult films of all time, and I can't imagine going through life without it - that is, if you have the tiniest bit of a sense of fun and humor.\n",

      "Edited this review on 10/28/08.<br /><br />Ever since I saw Beetlejuice as a kid I have found more and more to like about it with each viewing. Throw in some bizarre concepts and characters, add humor and cool old school special effects, top it all off with an outstanding wacky performance by Michael Keaton and you might begin to understand why it works. This movie is just so much fun to watch mainly because it combines so many genres and to this day it remains one of the most unique takes on a ghost story.<br /><br />I have the old 1997 (were DVDs around then?) DVD release and the picture and sound isn't that great. This Blu-ray is like a whole new experience in terms of video and audio quality. It's worth the upgrade if you like Beetlejuice as much as I do.\n",

      "For last night's movie, I though I'd try something a little different. I had a copy of \"Beetlejuice\" which I picked off the bargain rack at a nearby Ross Store. It was a Tim Burton movie. Hmmmm. Tim Burton has turned out some really weird movies and some of them I haven't particularly cared for. Well, \"Beetlejuice\" was weird, all right, but it was also funny in a bizarre fashion. For example, how could you set up an attractive and enjoyable couple and then make their death by automobile accident funny? Well, they did it and it involved a small dog. Or how could you have a movie dwelling on death and the thereafter and have an underworld waiting room of dead people being processed to their next place. Oh, and with an incompetent staff. It's bizarre! And funny. Especially the dismembered lady who was in two parts sitting side by side or the guy with the shrunken head. What kind of people dream this kind of stuff up? Keep on alert when watching a Tim Burton movie, for a lot of the humor is strictly visual. You'll see some of the strangest things, including visual puns.<br /><br />In any case, a delightful young newly-married couple were fixing up an old New England manor, but had a fatal automobile accident nearby. Their ghosts (which could be seen by no one) returned to their house, but were confined to the home and could not go outside. Of course, the house was eventually sold and a new couple, together with a goth teenage girl, moved in. The ghosts tried everything to scare the new intruders away but with negative results. Finally, they enlisted the services of Beetlejuice, a renegade ghost himself, and somewhere along the line, the ghost couple made friends with the goth teenager, who was able to see them. Well, this story has so many weird twists and turns I couldn't possibly keep it straight. It's about the most strangely unfolding plot I can ever remember seeing.<br /><br />I found the movie interesting, somewhat humorous and somewhat enjoyable. Most certainly, it was a very strange spectacle to watch. It was within the subject of horror movies, but there was no horror. It was funny. However, I'm just not into the supernatural and the afterlife and things of that sort, so I probably missed a lot of the subtle humor that would be picked up by people who are so immersed. The movie is complex enough and fast moving so I'd have to watch it several times in order to pick up on all the subtle twists and turns. It's classic Tim Burton, I'll say that.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",

      "Here's the plot of 1988's \"Beetlejuice\", significantly simplified:<br /><br />A young couple who've recently died find that another family is moving into their house. They must haunt their home and drive the family away, but find it nearly impossible to do. So, new to the afterlife and oblivious to the danger involved, they seek assistance from the kooky bio-exorcist Beetlejuice to help them freak the new family out. But the spirit realm's menace of a ghost has some choatic plans of his own.<br /><br />As for some of the cast and crew:<br /><br />Tim Burton as a director has almost always succeeded in delivering spectacular films, and this is no exception. His strange visual style is mesmerizing as usual. Danny Elfman's theme (as well as the rest of the score) is brilliant. Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin were obviously great choices as the recently deceased couple. Catherine O'Hara and Jefferey Jones fit quite well as the parents of the invading family, with their goth-daughter played by the heavenly Winona Ryder. And, last but not least, the character of Beetlejuice is portrayed perfectly by Michael Keaton.<br /><br />And for my personal opinion:<br /><br />Keaton stole the show, no doubt about it. I think the main reason anyone should see this is for the whacky charismatic character of Beetlejuice. From some of the best one-liners you'll ever hear, to the nutty antics he applies to practically everything he does, he's one of the greatest characters ever to grace the screen. Superbly supported by an extensive cast and crew that knew what they were doing and everything that was needed for a classic comedy of twisted themes, there is no denying the power of such a film. This is a must-see for sure (and for most, a must-own).\n",

A lot of films such as Monkey Bone have tried to copy it's strange originality and have failed.

      "I'd have to say that this isn't really a top favorite from master filmmaker Tim Burton, but it's not at all horrible. It's a classic display of Burton's wild imagination and clever imagery. It's a great comedy, and it's not only Burton's directing that makes it a laughfest. Michael Keaton is perfect as Beetlejuice; I don't think no one else can equally play the character like he does. But it's too bad he only appears in the film in a total of ten minutes. Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis shine as the deceased married couple, who want an eccentric family out of their perfect house. Catherine O'Hara, Jeffrey Jones, and Winona Ryder give nice performances, and Robert Goulet's cameo appearance is a treat.<br /><br />Oh, and let's not forget Danny Elfman's music score. This is awe-inspiring pre-Batman stuff right here; the main theme is VERY catchy. Art direction and costume design are a plus. The only flaw I can find here is the dance sequence in the end of the film. It's pretty corny, and I find it very annoying. But overall, this is a fun film for the older crowd.\n",

It now IS available on Bllu-Ray and it looks better; nothing outstanding, but a definite improvement in shapnress.<br /><br />Several characters in here - mainly Michael Keaton's unique and sometimes- revolting title character \"Beetlejuice\"- are always fascinating to watch. With him - and the whole movie - you also get a lot of humor and scary special-effects..<br /><br />It was odd to see Alec Baldwin in such a low-key role. In the '90s, he played very few of these type of guys. Davis looks and acts like...well, Davis, who many times has  played nice people that viewers like. It took me four viewings before I finally appreciated Catharine O'Hara's comedic talents in this movie. Now, she's my favorite and someone I find absolutely hilarious as the messed-up wife/mother of a family who moves into a \"haunted house\" inhabited by Baldwin and Davis.<br /><br />Keaton made himself a name as an actor with this whacked-out Robin Williams-type role, although he never really followed up with anything that was as popular as this film. Winona Rider is cute as the teenage daughter and we get other fun supporting roles from diverse people as talk show host Dick Cavett, singer Robert Goulet and actor Jeffrey Jones. All of them are good.<br /><br />Tim Burton directed the film and so I wasn't surprised there were the typical occult themes with ghosts and the like, and no heaven or hell but some other strange existence being touted where dead people go....a ridiculous picture of the afterlife. However, I just chalk it up to someone just trying to make a fun, entertaining picture and on that, it succeeds.<br /><br />Overall, a unique and entertaining film.

      "Beetlejuice is coming back to DVD in a newly remastered 20th Anniversary Deluxe Edition, in both standard definition and Blu-ray, on September 16th, 2008.  The extras announced so far are very limited: three episodes of the Saturday morning Beetlejuice cartoon series (\"Skeletons in the Closet,\" \"Spooky Boo-tique,\" \"A-Ha!\"), and for the Blu-ray version an exclusive CD soundtrack sampler.  Possibly more features will be announced later, but don't count on it.  The new Blu-ray will be 1080p video, but the specs for the sound haven't been announced.<br /><br />Beetlejuice is a very Tim Burtonesque Tim Burton movie, establishing his fascination with the macabre and, especially in this case, the funny, campy side of death and horror.  It's the story of a newly dead couple (Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin) who are essentially stuck as ghosts in their house, and don't like its new owners (parents Jeffrey Jones and Catherine O'Hara and daughter Winona Ryder).  They enlist the help of a more experienced, half-crazy but very insistent ghost, Beetlejuice (Michael Keaton), in an effort to scare the new owners away by haunting them.  Beetlejuice turns out to have his own agenda, and alliances shift as the story winds through learning to be dead, afterlife bureaucracy, wild chases through small spaces, Calypso dancing at dinner to Harry Belafonte's \"Banana Boat Song\" (\"Day-O\"), a very goth wedding ceremony, and supernatural comeuppance.<br /><br />The cast, for the most part, is perfectly suited to the wacky material, the sets and make-up and other effects very imaginative, the story engaging.

      "*** 1/2 stars rating for &quot;Beetlejuice&quot;. This movie was one of the biggest surprises in 1988, it revolutionized the visual effects field, established Tim Burton as a director with a huge imagination, put Winona Ryder on the map, and helped Burton & Michael Keaton to be signed by Warner Bros. to film their strongest 1989 project: &quot;Batman&quot;.<br /><br /> &quot;Beetlejuice&quot; is a very funny ghosts tale with a lot of creativity and imagination, the characters are easy to love, the situations are funny and bizarre at the same time, all this translates into a very entertaining movie.<br /><br /> There are several memorable scenes in &quot;Beetlejuice&quot;, among them a possession scene at the tune of Harry Belafonte's &quot;Banana Boat Song&quot;, another is the one on which Adam & Barbara (Alec Baldwin & Geena Davis respectively) are taken to the underworld offices.<br /><br /> &quot;Beetlejuice&quot; is a good option to see the gorgeous Winona Ryder in one of her key roles, to see the creativity of Tim Burton at his best, and to see a very funny supernatural comedy.\n",

      "Simply put: Beetlejuice is the funniest comedy of its kind since Ghostbusters.<br />  Michael Keaton plays the title character, a fun-loving ghost that likes to do mischief.  Beetlejuice is called by a couple (Davis and Baldwin) to get rid of the people who live in thier house.\n",

      "When Barbara (Geena Davis) and Adam(Alec Baldwin) Maitland move out into the country, they have rest and relaxation on their mind. Not even the well-meaning but intrusive antics of uber-realator Jane Butterfield (Annie McEnroe) can rattle their spirits.<br /><br />...until they discover that they died on an old country bridge near their house after a dog stopped balancing a broken bridge beam. After 'somehow' returning to their house, the Maitlands discover the 'Handbook for the recently deceased' and attempt to decipher it.<br /><br />The plot thickens when the Detzes move in from New York; Jane finally was able to sell their house. Delia (Catherine O'Hara) fancies herself an artist, but husband Charles (Jeffery Jones) just wants to relax in the country after having survived stressful city life. Both he and gothic daughter Lydia (Winnona Ryder) are the most likeable ones in this family.<br /><br />After their own attempts at the supernatural fail, the Maitlands call up Beetlejuice, a disgruntled former bureaucrat for the living impaired. Because their caseworker will not help them get rid of the Detzes, the Maitlands soon turn to Beetlejuice for assistance. The Maitlands want their house back, and do not want to become circus attractions for Lydia's equally loopy friends.<br /><br />Otho (Glen Shadix) is in this play only to show that some people really only talk big. During the supernatural ceremony he puts on an attitude of being in charge 'until something goes wrong'. Since it's likely that he was reading this ceremony as he went along, Otho had not known what he was doing. In other films, this would be dangerous for everybody within a close radius, but Beetlejuice comes to save the day.<br /><br />Michael Keaton steals the show as a fast/smooth-talking demon. He's not an angel, but you definitely want him on your side when the chips are down. The only thing he is really scared of is sandworms (in the otherworld). Keaton would later continue to work with Burton on the first two Batman movies, as of now considered the best in that series.<br /><br />Despite the gothic/gloomy tone of this film, it does end on a happy note. The Maitlands and the Detzes end up living together in the same house and Lydia actually gets along with the former couple.\n",

      "Well, we already knew Tim Burton has a delightfully warped sense of humor, didn't we? So it came as no surprise to me that this movie was both warped and hilariously funny.<br /><br />Adam and Barbara Maitland (Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis) are a charming young couple that live in a large old house on the edge of a small town. They love each other very much, very playful and fun together, and have just settled in for three weeks of vacation to work on their hobby: a scale model of the entire town. It's really good, too. Also, apparently they renovated the old house themselves.<br /><br />One day they went into town to get some supplies for the model and on the way home, went through a covered bridge. That is, through the side of the covered bridge into the river. They found themselves back at home, but eventually realized that they had died and were now haunting the place. That would be OK, except that their neighbor, a real estate agent, promptly sold the place to the Deetz, a severely dysfunctional family from the city. In no time at all, the wife has thrown out all the comfortable old things Adam and Barbara had, and put in horrible modern junk based on the dreadful tastes of her friend, an interior decorator. Also on her own sculptures, which are arguably the ugliest things you have ever seen produced by anyone over the age of five.<br /><br />The only redeeming aspect of the Deetz family is their teenage daughter Lydia (Winona Ryder). She dresses in black, is very morbid, but also is the only one able to see Adam and Barbara. And she is in sympathy with their assessment of her step-mother's horrible taste. Also horrible attitude.<br /><br />They don't quite know what to do, but when they returned to the house after the accident (actually, I think it was after the funeral), they found a book titled \"Guidebook for the Recently Deceased.\" They tried to read it, but there was no index, and it didn't seem to make a lot of sense to them. They did manage to draw a door through to a bureaucratic nightmare where they were told to talk to their caseworker. Turns out their caseworker is an abrupt, shriveled old woman who smokes constantly and the smoke seeps out through a large slash in her neck. She warns them not to contact Beetlejuice, who used to be her assistant but \"went out on his own.\" He had left an advertisement in their handbook, and for good measure, managed to put one on their TV.<br /><br />Still, when Lydia reads their handbook and does all she can to help them, they still haven't gotten rid of the Deetz family. In desperation, they call on Beetlejuice (Michael Keaton). You have to say his name three times to call him, which suggestions that he is a demon. Actually, I think the suggestion is also made that he's an alien. It's hard to be sure.<br /><br />The funniest parts of the movie are Beetlejuice's attempts to frighten the Deetz away: or at least the parents. He likes Lydia, and in fact wants her to marry him.<br /><br />There are lots and lots of inside-joke type references throughout, especially in the underworld bureaucracy. It's a very Tim Burton sort of film altogether.\n",

      "Maybe the definitive Burton film (or maybe more like a tie with `Edward Scissorhands'), `Beetlejuice' is a perfect representation of what Tim Burton is all about.  It is loud and boisterous and at the same time dark and edgy.  The film very much looks and feels like almost everything that comes out of the Burton factory, yet it is surprisingly fresh in a way.  Maybe this has to do with the fact that it is one of his earlier works and so the colors and graphics are not as crisp, which adds an almost gothic layer to the films feel.<br /><br />Then again, maybe it is the mere fact that Michael Keaton gives the best performance in any Burton film; ever.<br /><br />The film follows Adam and Barbara as they learn to cope with life after death.  Yes, a horrific car accident leaves Adam and Barbara dead yet confined to their home.  The problem is that their impatient neighbor takes no time in selling their home to an eccentric family that does not meet with their approval.  Determined to remove these people from their home they enlist the help of a `bio-exorcist' to do the trick, but they get far more than they bargained for when Beetlejuice comes on the scene.<br /><br />The film has been labeled as `pointless fun' by most of my friends, and to an extent I have to agree.  Many would claim the film is not pointless, for it teaches lessons of acceptance and friendship, and I guess loyalty and respect, but really, are we concerned with any of that?<br /><br />The acting is really good here, and it elevates the film from `pointless' to `pointless fun'.  Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis (complete with those alien eyes she had popping in `The Fly') are absolutely amazing as the dead couple, Adam and Barbara.  Catherine O'Hara is marvelous, award worthy even, as the insanely annoying Delia, and Jeffery Jones knows just how to compliment her as Charles.  Winona Ryder is effectively weird as their daughter Lydia.<br /><br />This film belongs to Keaton though, in what may very well be his finest performance, ever.  There is a fine line to be ridden between hilariously on-point and drastically over-the-top; especially when you are dealing with a typically campy performance.  As Beetlejuice, Keaton finds that line and rides it well, delivering an all over the place comedic performance that never feels `too much', even though it probably is.  He understands how to make his characters insanity justifiably funny and makes him an iconic character.  Everyone knows who Beetlejuice is, even if you haven't seen the movie.<br /><br />In the end I can recommend this movie because it does the trick.  It's sweet and charming in that Tim Burton style, complete with edge and creeps and hilarious thrills.  It looks better than his new stuff because it still has a level of grit, and while it is not as good as `Edward Scissorhands' (his best movie, ever) it is definitely a film that every fan needs to see.\n",

      "I won't go into detail about the movie itself, which has been reviewed in much greater detail and much better than I can do at the moment (it is one of my all time favorite movies - 5 stars).  I'd like to focus on the DVD for a moment.<br /><br />This DVD was released in June, 1997, a scant three months after the initial rollout of the DVD format.  As such, the inadequate menus and lack of functionality reflect a company just learning its way around the capabilities of the format.  The early releases have standard menu designs (with the Warner Logo), standard extras (cast & crew, production notes, trailer (sometimes)), and are usually double-sided with a widescreen format on one side and a fullscreen format on the other.  This was all quite adequate for 1997, but....<br /><br />In 2006, Beetlejuice seems to have been forgotten by Warner.  In a time when so many movies have \"Special\", \"Extra Special\", \"Extra-Extra Special Extended\", and \"Ultimate\" editions, this is one movie which has missed the bandwagon.

I'm older now, obviously, but I still cannot get enough of this movie. <p>Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis play Adam and Barbara Maitland, two Connecticut yuppies who die prematurely in a car wreck. Within a couple weeks, their home is overrun by an ultra-trendy New York City family, Charles and Delia Deetz, and their Goth daughter, Lydia (played respectively by Jeffrey Jones, Catherine O'Hara, and Winona Ryder). Adam and Barbara want their house back, and attempt to scare the Deetz's out of the house by wearing sheets and even by possessing them over dinner, making them sing and dance to Harry Belafonte's \"Day O.\" Those attempts fail and enter Michael Keaton as Betelguese, \"the afterlife's leading freelance bio-exorcist.\" The movie is dark without being scary and funny without being ridiculous. <p>In my opinion, one of the real gems in this film is the late Sylvia Sidney as Juno, Your Case Worker. Sidney was pushing eighty when this film was made, but turns in a great performance as the embittered equivalent of an afterlife social worker.

      "I love this film.  Barbara and Adam Maitland, a young couple madly in love (played by Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin) discover that they are not only dead but trapped in their home as ghosts waiting for the bureaucracy of the afterlife to set them free.  When a New York couple (Catherine O'Hara and Jeffrey Jones) and their teenage daughter Lydia (wonderfully macabre Winona Ryder) move into their beloved house, the Maitlands want nothing more than to remove them.  The problem is, the Maitlands are too nice to truly scare anyone.  They meet a rogue ghost, the ribald, disgusting Beetlejuice (Michael Keaton) who promises to drive the family away, with a few strings attached.  Lydia, whose goals aren't that far from the Maitlands and who has a morbid, poignantly sad outlook, discovers the ghosts and tries to help them.  But Beetlejuice has his own agenda.<br /><br />The casting for this movie is perfect, with only Alec Baldwin's performance less than memorable.  Michael Keaton is suitably slimy and decadent, while Geena Davis plays the earnest innocence of her character equally well.  The most startling performance is a young Winona Ryder, who shows tremendous range in her role as the morbid but good-hearted Lydia.<br /><br />One of the most hilarious, dark scenes ever filmed is contained in this movie, when the New York couple throws a pretentious dinner party and the Maitlands take over. Director Tim Burton uses sight gags, situational comedy, and one-liners that all bear his trademark quirkiness to make this film inventive and, even years after its release, fresh.  What's most amazing in this film essentially about the weirdness of being dead is the emotional drive of it.  The Maitlands' yearning to reclaim their home even in death and Lydia's wounded, lonely adolescence lend humanity to an otherwise wild comedy.<br /><br />I highly recommend this off-beat film for its hilarity and irreverence.  Parents of young children should be warned that the film contains off-color humor as well as images and ideas that might disturb young minds. -- Debbie Lee Wesselmann\n",

      "As a few of the other reviews have said, as long as you pick a good location, these traps work really well.  I had a few false starts with some less defined tunnels but as soon as I picked a tunnel where the route was very clear, I caught my mole within 24 hours.<br />A nice thing about this trap is that you don't have to dig down into the ground to place them.  Just stick them into the ground where you find a well used tunnel.  I bought two, but I actually think one would have been totally fine.  It seems pretty sturdy too, so if we get any more moles in the future I will be ready!<br />All in all, I would certainly recommend this product.\n",

      "I am known in the neighborhood as \"The Mole Man\" as I will catch moles for my friends.  Recently some low-life stole my trusty old Victor mole traps right out of my neighbor's front yard. I have found the harpoon type to be the most effective trap made.<br /><br />I replaced them with what I thought would be identical traps.  Alas, they are of the same basic design, but are made lighter and cheaper.  I have doubts about them holding up like the old ones.  The steel parts are lighter, and the protective zinc coating (galvanizing) questionable.\n",

      "I have a large yard with several moles.  I called a mole/pest removal company.  I hired them and paid 200.00 to have about a dozen traps set (yes, they used these exact traps which is why I ordered some for myself).<br /><br />Anyway, they had 30 days to trap moles in my yard.  They also charged 69.00 for each mole they caught.  They got 5 moles in that time.<br /><br />That may not seem like many, but if you read about moles, you'll find out they are not like mice or rats.  They breed slowly and live alone.  They reproduce once per year and maybe have 2-4 offspring of which maybe half will live in natural conditions.  When you see an area or network of mole tunnels (your grass pushed up), that's just one mole... If you study the tunnels, you'll usually see it comes in from the edge of your yard where there may be more moisture (forest or wild area).<br /><br />You just need to look at the branching of the tunnels and find a few areas where you can guess the mole may be re-using that section to go back and forth.<br /><br />Once you locate a good spot, gently push the grass down to collapse the tunnel, and set the trap.  Be sure to set the trap so the spikes that go in the ground (not the spikes that kill the mole) are not right in the middle of the mole tunnel.  The idea (obviously) is to set the trap in an area the mole will try to use again.  When the mole tries to fix the tunnel, bam!<br /><br />I just trapped my first mole today.  I saw the spring of the trap was down, took the trap up, and the mole was dead underneath.<br /><br />This trap does work to kill the mole.  YOu just need to put it in the right place and set it correctly.<br /><br />The guy who worked for the pest control company told me most of this and it really makes a difference.<br /><br />I'm here to buy a few more traps.  I would suggest getting two traps for each distinct area you think there may be a mole.  I plan to just keep rotating 4-6 traps until all the moles are gone.\n",

      "I tried everything to get my mole to leave peacefully. I sprayed castor oil, used mole repellent pellets, etc. He might leave for a week or two, but then he would be back.<br /><br />I purchased the Victor Mole Trap, read the instructions, studied a bit on the web, and rid my yard of moles in three days. GREAT product.<br /><br />The previous reviewers don't understand that you're not really trying to \"trap\" the mole with the spikes. In all likelihood you will maim the mole and he will go off to die. You won't really know whether you got him until you notice that no new tunnels are being built. And you do need to pay attention to your yard before setting the trap. Figure out where the mole likes to travel by flattening his tunnels and watching where they reappear. Try to think like the mole and you'll get him.\n",

      "Picked up a set of 2 at the local home improvement store for ~$11.  The design of this trap seems to count on the animal pushing dirt in front of him and the dirt is what sets off the trap.  In these instances, the gopher will likely be caught behind the neck or shoulders.  I see a lot of holes on our property where the hole is not plugged and plenty of sign that he has been out scampering around.  In these cases, he'll get caught in the hip area with his nose up against where the trigger plate would be set.  This just makes it a little more awkward in emptying the trap.  The cinch type trap looks to be just as effective but much easier to empty.  The cinch trap will cost up to 2-3 times more, though.  I might get one or two cinch traps, but 9/10 will be the 610 type.<br /><br />I have read at least one review where the sweep of the jaws could be an issue, preventing the trap from being seated in small holes and from closing effectively.  This is really easy to work around.  I first thought to shorten the jaws, but decided to just make the hole bigger when setting it.  I learned that gophers are not shy of these traps or your activity around the hole.  In very short order you can excavate the hole to a size that allows the trap to operate freely...and the gopher will come...especially if you notice fresh activity around the hole.<br /><br />Much of the literature on setting traps recommends digging back from the plugged hole to access the main tunnel and then set the traps in pairs so the gopher has to enter a trap from either direction in order to replug the hole.  I have found this is not really necessary.  If the hole I am working was freshly plugged, one trap in the hole works every time.<br /><br />I also noticed that a small plug doesn't necessarily mean a small gopher.  In one instance, I almost passed on setting a trap in what I thought was just going to be wasted effort.  I cleared dirt from a plug the size of a 50 cent piece and it opened up into a tunnel about 2 1/2 inches!  The gopher I got out of that hole was a normal sized gopher!<br /><br />I also read that a 3 degree difference in the gopher's comfort zone in the burrow is enough to cause him to do something about it.  The fact that light appears at a point he previously plugged is also enough for him to quickly come back and see what happened.  One the first day I used these, I set one, then walked about 30 yards away and set another.  I checked the first one on the way back a few minutes later and found it had been tripped and completely covered.  I had to dig it out and found the little bugger had pushed a rock the size of a bird's egg into it!  My first catch was a rock!  A Bill Murray moment flashed through my mind.  That gopher is now history, by the way.<br /><br />I am working with only 2 traps at the moment and secure them with a piece of butcher twine to my tunnel probe or a 12\" piece of 1/4 in re-bar.  This size hardware is probably overkill.  You can probably tie the traps to those marking flags on wire type stems available at your local home improvement store, especially if you are setting a lot of traps.  They may not need to be secured at all.  When that gopher's body in in the trap, he isn't really going anywhere.  If he can go anywhere with it, it might be best to let THAT gopher keep it as a souvenir!<br /><br />If you are not having any success at all with these traps, it would be a good idea to re-examine how and where the traps are being set.  I have never used these things before and only bought this set after 4 years of poison pellets simply didn't work.  Look for FRESH activity and don't be shy about providing enough room for these traps to work.  So far, have set these only at holes that have been plugged, but will set the next time where there is fresh sign but no plug.  I don't bait mine and the trigger plate can ALWAYS be seen from above after I set them...easier to check them.  From all the mounds on our 2 acres, am guessing we have at least 40 gophers or more.  These traps will be busy and I'll be keeping score.<br /><br />I give the trap 5 stars for effectiveness and 4 stars for the emptying issue.  From my experience, no need to spend a lot of money....these things work.\n",

      "I ordered the Victor 0610 Easy Set Gopher Trap after exhausting all other methods of trapping and killing a sneaky little gopher.<br /><br />We received the trap before the expected delivery date, so the shipping was very prompt.  I was disappointed after opening the box because there were no instructions included, though.  I searched for instructions online only to come up with hard to see diagrams with small print.  After playing with it for several minutes I was able to figure out how to set the trap.  Our crafty little gopher didn't mound up for several days after receiving the trap so we couldn't use it immediately.  When the shifty little creature finally did mound up my husband cleaned out the hole to make it slightly larger, set the trap and then secured the trap so that the gopher couldn't run off with it.  He decided to cover the mound with a wagon so that light wouldn't enter the hole.  When I went outside to check the trap a few hours later we had trapped the guileful gopher.  The gopher was still alive when we pulled it of the hole but he was quickly eliminated.  This gopher had managed to destroy a large portion of my yard and evaded us for 3 months.<br /><br />I wish I had found the Victor 0610 Easy Set Gopher Trap before I spent more than $50 on the other methods that didn't work.  I highly reccomend this product.\n",

      "I purchased a single Victor 0610 at the same time as a pair of Sweeney 9013. I found the Sweeney very difficult to use, due to wire construction that flexed while being set, and both Sweeney tripped without snagging the critters.<br /><br />I set the Victor in the same tunnel that the first Sweeney had been in, and caught a gopher within 10 minutes. I then replaced the second Sweeney, which had been tripped (but no gopher caught) with the Victor 0610, within twenty minutes another gopher had been snagged. I then placed the Victor in a third tunnel and again snagged a gopher within 20 minutes.<br /><br /> The other model has been relegated to the tool shed and I have ordered two more of the Victor 0610.\n",

The traps works as advertised.  Very strong spring action so keep pets and hands out of the way of a set trap.  I placed small garden buckets over the traps to help avoid pet interaction.<br /><br />Update: 10/7/10 -- I've trapped 4 moles with this trap.  It continues to work very well.

      "This trap has been so effective that it has almost taken the challenge out of trapping moles in my yard.  I had tried other types of traps and was disappointed with the results. I've put my other experiences at the end if you are interested.<br /><br />As with any trap, it must be set in an active tunnel and it took a couple attempts to learn to set the Out O Sight.  However, once learned and active tunnels found, I have a 100% tripped trap/dead mole ratio.  As several others have said, following the directions sets the trap too deep.  On the other hand, the method described in other reviews here was too shallow to work for me.<br /><br />I have a recently re-graded yard with new topsoil trucked in so the soil is still fairly loose.  The top of most of the mole tunnels are about 3-4\" deep.  Pushing the tunnel down and setting the trap on top without digging down proved too shallow.<br /><br />The technique that has worked for me is similar to that on the box, but not quite as deep as described.  Carefully excavate a section of the tunnel as wide as the trap and as deep as the bottom of the tunnel without disrupting the structure of the bottom half of the tunnel ... the bottom half of the walls and the floor.  Then take a few clumps of the dirt (it has been very wet here since starting to trap) and put them in the tunnel between where the claws of the trap will go.  Don't pack it tight, just drop them in.  Set the trap with the claws slightly deeper than the bottom of the tunnel by pressing it in.  The trip pan should sit on the clumps you put in.  Put the remainder of the soil back around the tunnel opening you made and around the trap to block out the light.  Do your best not to disrupt the tunnel leading up to the trap's jaws and don't pack it too tighly.  You want the mole to be in the jaws before encountering blockage.<br /><br />I have been holding the trip pan down while pushing the trap to the desired depth so I don't accidentally set it off and then making sure the release side of the trip pan is not tight against the soil which would possibly prevent it from springing.<br /><br />Since starting in November, the count is 10 with 3 of them in the last week.  Most of the time I have my quarry within 12 hours of setting the trap .  The time it will take is directly dependent on finding an actively used tunnel.  I patrol my yard almost every day and get the trap in immediately after finding a new tunnel.<br /><br />I have docked the device one star because the jaw of one of the first two traps I bought inexplicably cracked.  Also because I think it could be easier to set, but practice makes perfect. (use caution)  Despite this, the trap has been so effective and much less expensive than the alternatives that I have purchased 3 additional traps to replace the broken one and the other traps I have purchased that were not effective.<br /><br /> Plunging spear type:  Anchoring seemed to be an issue as well as spring strength to reach the mole in the heavy clay soil here.  The trap would be tripped, but no mole under it.<br /> Trapline in-tunnel wire trap:  A device that is genius in its simplicity and would likely do well in dryer soil than I was trying to trap in.  My experience was the moles digging around the device.  Perhaps I just didn't master setting it.  I also didn't like having to dig up the trap to see if it was tripped.<br /> Poison pellets:  Not sure if the moles took them or not.  Worked too slowly to stop the damage, so a worthless approach in my mind.\n",

      "Another mole hunter from St Louis here. I have tried everything: pellets, smoke bombs, different poisons, flooding the holes, a pretty useless trap sold in Lowes and Home Depot (I did get one mole last year with this but it's very weak and flimsy. I think I was lucky). A friend of mine told me she was fed up and was going to pay a professional to catch her moles. He caught 2 of them in a couple of weeks and she hasn't had a problem since. I asked her if she could figure out what kind of trap he used. Well, this is the one!<br /><br />Since I bought these traps a few months ago, I have caught 5 moles (that includes 1 for my neighbor). Despite having caught 4 moles in my front and back yards, there is still new  activity from time to time. I think they cover the whole neighborhood. I have some traps in my yard and a couple in my neighbor's across the street. I have purchased 6 traps (they are a great price and VERY sturdy) and I'm about to purchase 2 more to send to my in-laws.<br /><br />The way I have found these work for me is as follows:<br />1. Try to pick out a tunnel that looks like a common route or \"freeway.\" For me, it's usually close to a path or driveway where they have hit the \"wall\" and work their way along it. Don't stomp all the raised tunnels down unless there are so many you need to find a place to start.<br />2. By keeping the tunnel open and just pushing down the dirt in the area you intend to place the trap, the next time the mole comes by he will just start digging his way right into the trap. I like to keep the soil pretty loose where the trap is going to be placed so when the ground gets hard and baked, the trap will still be able to spring shut quickly. Just make sure the holes on both sides of the trap are covered. The dirt in the compressed area is usually about an inch or less below the rest of the ground.<br />3. Remember to use the safety catch when placing the trap in the ground. You want to make sure the flat base of the trap, (the part the mole will push up when he tunnels to trigger the trap) is well set in the ground and the four spikes in the ground are on either sides of the tunnel. It may be a little difficult to set the trap but it's not THAT hard to do. Come on!<br />4. Be patient. The first time I set a trap I had a mole in less than twelve hours. The last one I caught was in a trap in my garden which I had set 3 weeks earlier. Of course if you see new activity in a different area, you may want to move the trap. Trial and error.<br /><br />****Somebody else claimed these traps are hard to set. Yes, the springs on them are very strong and it takes a little elbow grease. The trap does come with tools to help you set the trap. If it wasn't this strong I may as well use the useless trap from Lowes.\n",

There was no blood, but the mole was dead as a door nail.<br /><br />We run a 35 acre condo complex and have had VERY little luck with spear traps and poison worms.

It only took about a week. I got another one a week later. I did follow other reviews by not burying it like instructions say but to place it over a stamped down tunnel.

      "I've had a problem with moles for just a few months, but they have done quite a bit of damage to my yard in that short time.  After reading the positive reviews, I decided to try the Out of Sight trap.  It took me a few weeks but I finally caught one mole (I'm sure there's more out there).<br /><br />I tried following the directions on the box as well as the directions in the reviews here.  I didn't have much success with just cutting slits for the blades and leaving the trap at ground level.  I eventually dug up a small area and I noticed that the hole runs were actually a little deeper than the blades would go if left on top of the grass. The cool weather may have something to do with the moles digging deeper; or I simply chose a bad spot. However, it was the most active area so seemed to be a logical choice to set the trap.<br /><br />So, I basically followed the included instructions and finally caught my first mole.  As others have said, you may need to finish off the little diggers yourself so just be prepared for that...I guess a shovel is the best tool for the job.  The traps do require a bit of strength to set and you need to be careful with them as the spring is very strong. At first glance it looks like some kind of medieval torture device.<br /><br />Another thing to remember is that often times moles are simply a symptom of other problems - mostly likely lawn grubs. I'm certainly not an expert, but it sounds like moles feed largely on these grubs. So getting rid of the grubs may prevent future moles...that's next on my to do list.\n",

      "I have a little less than half an acre of yard, which is right against a wooded green space. Moles have been a problem for us since we moved in three years ago. Poison pellets, poison worms, spike trap, smoke bombs, scoot mole...All of these I've tried and, if they worked, it sure wasn't noticeable to me. At my wit's end, I called a professional service two months ago to control the mole problem. For $180, for one month of service, they placed 6 of these very same traps. The problem is, they came every week to check on the traps. So, one month later and one mole later (an additional $35 for removal of the dead mole), they yanked the traps. Well, one dead mole was better than my previous record of zero and I couldn't possibly justify spending another $180 + $35 for each dead mole for this service, so I ordered four of my own.<br /><br />The day I received them, one month ago, I placed all of them out along runs that, of course, magically popped up when the service had terminated. That very evening, while out on the patio, we heard a snap. The trap I had placed on the main run coming from the woods had caught one heading in the direction of my yard. The next day I removed the traps and stamped down all the runs. Around a week later, I spotted more runs so I placed the traps again. The next morning, I had another one. I waited a day or so, pulled the traps and stamped down the runs. The next time I saw runs was this past weekend. I placed all the traps again around 3pm. About 2 hours later (no, I'm not exaggerating), I had another mole. I pulled that trap, but left the others behind. The next morning another trap was full. For $53.72 I have trapped 4 moles and have been able to keep the moles from devastating my yard.<br /><br />To say I am completely satisfied with this product would be an understatement. In my opinion, this is the best solution out there to keep moles from destroying your yard. The advice I have regarding these traps is to make sure to buy enough traps to cover all the runs and increase your odds of trapping a mole. Additionally, be sure to be vigilant for the runs. At first sign, deploy your traps as you will likely increase the odds of trapping a mole in a run that was just made versus a run that is days old. Lastly, to deploy your traps successfully: 1)Find a relatively straight run (not those windy, loopy runs) 2)Stamp down just over a trap-width of the run with your foot 3)Set the trap and push it into the ground straddling the stamped-down run until the catch touches the ground 4)Enjoy the satisfaction of knowing, after you pull out your first sprung trap and the bane of your existence is dangling from the claws of the trap, that you just saved yourself years of frustration (and money!) by simply buying a few of these traps.

      "Thanks to Mr. Klos and a lot of other people who have added to this forum, I am now the proud owner of 5 of these mole traps with no more moles to trap (for now).  Mr. Klos' method probably would work best if I had not spent the summer smashing down the mole runs. They just dug deeper tunnels. Common sense and a little exploration told me the Klos method would put the squeezers ABOVE the tunnel.  But, other reviews told that, once they figured out that the poor instructions on the package were for deeper tunnels, they were successful. All my tunnels were too deep to use the Klos method.<br /><br />So, I dug up each main run and cleaned out each end of the tunnel to find the common middle ground.  I built a hard mound in the center of the open space.  I loaded the trap and put the safety on.  I placed the trap directly on top of the mound, with the spring barely touching the mound.  It was good I kept the safety on until I buried the trap because a couple times I put it so far down the spring sprung.<br /><br />So, which way is best?  The method that puts the bottom of the trap at the bottom of the run. Don't smash the tunnels down; then, the trap can be placed on the top of the ground merely by inserting two slits in a main run.  I followed the seller's instructions and it worked for deeper runs. Next year, the runs will be trapped without being stomped down first.  Happy hunting.\n",

      "This trap is effective.  It misses a 5 star rating because it can be difficult to set.  The Victor 0631 works well if you are willing to take 5-10 minutes to clearance the blade slots in the soil yourself and then set the trap \"just right\".  It may go off on you the first few times after you set it in the ground, so be prepared to set it multiple times.  It has a safety catch so it won't alarm you too much if it goes off when you place it in the ground.<br /><br />The Wire Tek 1001 is double the money but is set by simple foot operation which expands the blades, thus self-clearancing the soil blade slots.  The Victor 0631 is made in China which does not please me.  The Wire Tek 1001 is made in the USA and is more rugged.  Its clamping force is double as it has two springs which allows it to close very quickly and with authority.  Grass and roots will not interfere with the Wire Tek's effectiveness.\n",

      "The trap caught him on the arm. He was still alive flopping around on the ground when I got home, so I beat him in the head countless times with a trowel. I imagine it looked like that scene from A Christmas Story when Ralphie beats up the neighborhood bully.<br /><br />I still have quite a few more to catch though. I have 5 of these traps I got from Home Depot for $9.99 all set out in my yard right now. Mole hunting is like a deadly game of chess.\n",

      "I have tried to get rid of these buggers for over a year now. I have tried everything from chewing gum, insecticide for the grubs, flooding them with a garden hose ( I ran the hose down a main tunner for 8 hours before the water appeared out of another hole 20 feet away), mole poison, looked into a cosstly mole servicewithout any guarantees, and even considered a little gasoline at one time!<br /><br />The Mole Trap arrived yesterday April 19th 2012. I read the reviews and using the instructions from the reviewer (Thanks G Klos), I set the trap following the reviewers instruction and warned all of the family to be aware of the trap and to keep away from it. Shortly after 6 pm today Aprill 20th I found the trap sprung and there in the jaws was the critter that has wreaked havok on what was once a flat smooth front yard.<br /><br />Tomorrow I move to the back yard.<br /><br />This trap is incredible.\n",

      "I have had the trap in my fescue lawn for about 2 weeks.  I have moved it twice now.  The first location did not get anything but the second one caught my first mole after being set for 3 days.  I definitely recommend this style over the kind with the spikes that sit up above the ground.  The name is a little deceiving as the trap is not completely out of sight but it's fairly low profile and the part that could do the most damage to little hands and feet is already underground when it is set, so I feel that the kids are in very little danger playing in the yard nearby.<br /><br />The toughest part is identifying active runs.  The thicker the grass, the harder it is to identify where the runs are.<br /><br />The hunt continues...\n",

      "I previously bought a similar kind of trap in Europe, which was effective (don't buy mole bait-that does not help), but I needed more to catch all moles in our garden.. This trap however does not compare to the easy one I had already. You don't just need force to set it; you need an awful lot of it! Ladies beware, using this trap is a man's job only!!!<br /><br />On handling, beware to wear gloves, so you don't touch the trap with bare hands. Moles might be sensitive to that..\n",

      "I received the traps that I ordered and was glad that I had watched several videos on setting them as there is absolutely nothing in the box that really helps figure out how to set the trap effectively.  I am fairly literate when it comes to reading instructions and therefore, I consider the enclosed instructions only fair.  You can figure it out but that is exactly what you have to do is there is nothing in the illustrations that is all that helpful.<br /><br />So far I have not been successful in actually trapping a mole but still trying.  However, I am writing this review to caution the reader of something that could have been disastrous to me from using this device.  As I was checking one of the traps, I decided to move it so I set the safety loop over the bar as it is designed to be done.  AS I moved the trap, and I am still not sure what happened, the device sprung and instead of the safety catch stopping the action, it actually came off with great velocity hitting me in the forehead about 2 inches from my eye.  The wound is small but none the less, hurt like crazy and bled profusely.  I hate to think of it hitting me in the eye or mouth!  As I said, I don't know really what happened but still have not found the safety catch - maybe a mole will return it!  Be careful and I suggest wearing safety glasses when setting.\n",

      "Took a few days, but the mole finally got caught. The trap is fairly easy to set up. I think some of it is luck if the mole heads into the trap. But it did work for me, check out the pic of the catch for proof. I didnt want to kill the little guy, but he was really tearing up the lawn and he wasn't moving out.<br /><br />Probably the major con with this trap is it does take a lot of strength to open. If it was a little easier to open, I probably have given it 5 stars.\n",

      "I don't have lawn so I thought I could live with moles peacefully, as long as they don't destroy my landscaping. After two years those moles start popping up anywhere they want and dirt piles here and there. They are out of control. I have tried many baits and that ultra-sound thing, none of them work! I can't live with the moles anymore because my landscaping is being turned up-side down by them.<br /><br />I first bought one trap, after two weeks nothing happened. Then I bought another three. With all of these, I can make a trap field. I planted them last evening and this morning I went to check. Wahoo! One trap was triggered! I haven't looked at that it caught, but I am so sure there is a mole caught. I am so happy to write this review right after I saw the triggered trap.<br /><br />I think the most important thing is that, since mole is hard to track, you should use several traps together. Also on YouTube, there is a very nice video shows you how to set this trap up - build a dirt bridge, use some fresh tree leaves, etc. Carefully designing the trap field that was also contribute to the success.<br /><br />>>> I went to dig the mole out, this is my first experience on how a mole look like.

Not too sure/concerned about it I just let it be and was going to take measures in the fall to fill in the spots.<br /><br />Early spring rolls around and I have moles. I sprayed the yard with the oil stuff... didn't help, grub/worm stuff - either didn't work or i'm not patient enouh.<br /><br />I read the reviews and ended up buying 2 of these. I put them on what I thought were active trails/tunnels and after a day had no movement so I moved them again.<br /><br />Next day - BOOM! Got on and it pinched it's back, so it was still living to I relocated it to a field a few miles away. Put the trap in the SAME spot and next day BOOM! go another one - this one not so lucky...<br /><br />They work great - make sure just like the reviews state to cut two slits to fix the \"claws\" and to step down the ground even - remove the safety and you are good to go.\n",

      "I purchased 3 of the victor 0631 traps. They got to my house promptly.  There was a mole that troubled my lawn and flower beds for 3 months. I brushed aside conventional wisdom about mole behavior and the need to put traps only in frequently used main runs. I seeded the most recent activity with a total of 6 traps.  I carefully installed one of the new victor traps in a feeding run. Making sure the blades were free, and placing a mound of dirt in the center of the run to cause the mole to push through it and resulting in a trip of the trap. I poured fine dirt to close off light.  I also wore washed rubber gloves. I was also careful to set the trip on the very edge of the trip pan catch for hair trigger action.<br /><br />Next morning I came back and one of the purchased traps was sprung. The jaws of death closed on the neck of a huge mole. He was dead, the jaws of this trap are so powerful that they kill without fail. This was my first KILL with a victor trap.<br /><br />THEY WORK.  Just be careful with your fingers when you set these traps. Follow the basic steps outlined above and exercise patience, you will get them with this trap.\n",

I set it in the run used by an evil mole who repeatedly crossed my back yard on his way next door. I sprayed his run with castor oil products, Murphy soap, water with cayenne pepper powder in it--nothing phased this monster. Set this trap in his main highway, and next day, it had snagged the pest. Two days later found another mole run entering from another neighbor's yard. Set the trap, next morning, dead mole.<br /><br />I'm not bloodthirsty, but these creeps ruin my yard. I stopped short of cutting off their heads and sticking them on Popsicle sticks next to the runs. I did, though, leave the bodies buried securely in the tunnels. A message for any other intruders.<br /><br />A big thanks to Geoffrey Klos for his excellent instructions. Doubt I would have been successful following the package's instructions.\n",

      "These traps have a much better kill ratio than the other traps.  I have one of these, a harpoon trap, and some that you bury in the tunnels.<br /><br />Poisons, grub killers, and gasses probably don't work, and you will never have a body to know for sure.  Trapping is the best method.<br /><br />I've also flooded the tunnels then shot the mole.  Flooding the tunnels did more damage than the mole did.<br /><br />I've also nailed a couple with a harpoon trap too, but the scissor type is more effective and I rarely have a sprung trap with no mole.<br /><br />The out o sight scissor trap is the best one.<br /><br />People who are giving this bad reviews must not be setting it correctly, I had the same problems until I learned to set them right.<br /><br />Do a google or youtube search and learn how to set them right and you will catch them.<br /><br />1. Keep your grass short to help spot the tunnels.<br /><br />2. Pick a tunnel and set the trap correctly on that tunnel, stomp all of the other tunnels down flat, not the one your trapping on.<br /><br />3. If you haven't caught the mole in 48 hours, the tunnel is abandoned and needs to be relocated.  Stomp the tunnel down flat and move the trap to a different newer tunnel.<br /><br />I usually catch them overnight\n",

      "You must find the mole 'highways' which are the long straight runs that (for me) were easiest found beside the patio, sidewalk, or driveway.  Once you think you have identified one, simply mash down about a 2 foot long section.  My thought process was that if I pressed down the entire run, they might find an alternate route.<br /><br />So once you do this, check back in 24-48 hours to see if has been repaired.  If it has, then mash down a section the length of your foot, LEVEL with the rest of the surrounding grounds.  I have sand soil so I simply dug (with my finger) 2 small notches ACROSS the mole highway same distance apart as the trap death grips.<br /><br />I found it easy to set the trap by hand, using the directions on the box... but many other reviews here offer alternative methods.  Leave the 2 bars used to pry the trap open in place, it helps to position the trap in the ground.  Now, set the trap death grips down in the notches you have created (with SAFETY latch hooked!) The trigger plate should touch the LEVEL ground that you mashed down.  Keep a firm grip on the pry bars as the trap may trigger a few times until you get it touching the ground with light enough pressure not to trigger.  When you are happy, remove the pry bars, release the safety and enjoy the results.<br /><br />Start > Finish, of setting trap, maybe 3 minutes.<br /><br />My soil is pure sand, so my 'notches' mentioned above were almost non-existent because they kept back filling with sand as soon as I dug them out with my finger.  When I set the trap, the soil was in between the death grips, but it was loose enough to grab the mole, first night I had set the trap!<br /><br />Great trap, easy to use and set.  I may have had some beginners luck, but so far so good.\n",

      "I didn't have high expectations for this but it worked so I'll share what I did:<br /><br />I stamped down ALL of the tunnels in the yard the evening before.  The next morning I looked for new tunnel, especially long straight ones because apparently those are the ones most travelled.  I then placed the trap on said tunnel and I had a dead mole within two hours.  Like a previous reviewer, I did not follow the manufacturers instructions and instead followed his which I reccomend doing because it's not only easier but also works.\n",
      "518\n",
      "I've used two other types of traps besides this one: the plunger style (stabbing death from above) and the scissor style with foot activation (cut 'em in half). Neither worked very well--the scissor/foot style frustrated me the most because you have to compress the springs using your foot after the trap is positioned, and if the soil is somewhat damp, the whole trap will just squash into the ground.<br /><br />After the snow melted I discovered that the moles had been hard at work in my yard. I set the Victor trap on what I believed to be one of the mole \"highways\" and caught a critter WITHIN 6 HOURS. He was a big one too, almost 6 inches from nose to tail.<br /><br />PROS of the Victor trap:<br />* I like that you can set/compress the trap before you place it. This makes it easy to position it exactly how you want it in the ground.<br />* The safety catch is a nice feature. If you hit the trigger lever by accident, you won't hurt yourself.<br />* Trigger lever is VERY sensitive. This has been one of my frustrations with other traps--I can sometimes tell by the soil movement that moles are passing under it without tripping it.<br />* Price, $10 is cheaper than most other traps.<br /><br />CONS of the Victor trap:<br />* The instructions stink. Even disregarding the placement issue (see next point), it took me a few minutes to figure out how to compress the trap using the \"setting levers\" and trigger lever. It's a good design, just not well documented.<br />* Don't use the instructions on the box for placing the trap. I followed the advice of several other reviewers here who suggest cutting notches on either side of the tunnel for the trap blades to rest in. This turned out to be easier and more effective.<br /><br />If they just improved the instructions on the box, it'd be a five star review from me.\n",

      "I'm not sure why they call this the \"out-O'site mole trap\".  Although the actual mechanism that traps the mole is under ground, the top part (about 4 to 5 inches) still is above the ground.  I recommend that you cover it with a small plastic pail or flower pot, so other animals or kids don't set it off inadvertently.  So, far I haven't trapped a mole, but I think it's because I haven't set is in an area that the moles are currently active in.<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004RAMY\">Victor 0631 Out O'Sight Mole Trap</a>\n",

      "I chose this based on reviews.  It's not available locally in stores, and I learned that my mole problem would not be fixed using gopher/mole bait.<br /><br />This trap is fairly large.  It's all-metal with a VERY strong spring.  It's not the easiest thing to set, requiring a fair amount of force, and you need to be very careful with it.  If you catch a finger in it, I have no doubt you'd break it and you'd have a very difficult time trying to get out of it with only one working hand, so use care!!!<br /><br />The instructions could be a little more clear, but the trap is easy to figure out how it works once you examine it and set it once.  You do need to find a good location to set it, and make sure to create the mound in the middle that rests very closely to the trigger.  It only takes about 10 minutes to set once you figure it out.  I can probably do it under 5 minutes now.<br /><br />I suggest covering the trap with an upside down plastic pot with a weight on top to block out the light and to keep kids and other animals from accidentally getting into to it.  While the jaws will be below ground, it's still not something you'd want to trip or step on just in case.<br /><br />I set three of these traps along with 2 pairs of Trapline (check them out too... you'll have to search for them yourself... it's a California thing), not certain which would work and I was quite determined to get rid of my mole problem ASAP once it (or they) dug over 20 holds in my new lawn in 2 days.  The next morning... already caught the mole!  It was trap cleanly around the hips.  It wasn't a bloody mess at all, but it probably died from a combination of internal injuries, a broken spine, and asphyxiation.  Regardless, it was VERY dead.<br /><br />Bottom line... this trap is EFFECTIVE.  And that's the best I could ask for.  I probably have an overkill of traps, but I have extensive tunneling in my yard and wanted to catch the mole quickly before it did more damage.  I LOVE this trap and highly recommend it!\n",

      "I bought two of these two years ago.  First year I didn't need it since the moles left me alone.  This year however I have set it twice and caught a mole each time.  I'd previously tried other types of mole traps, i.e. spikes and hoops but with limited success.  (Seemes I had too many misses, sprung trap but no catches).  Having grown up on a farm and traping several types of critters I figured I knew how to trap moles too.  I felt strongly about this trap today after my second success in just two settings that I looked up my two year old purchase and wrote this.<br /><br />Aug. 19th, 2011<br />Mole #3 today.

I have always used the simple directions supplied with the trap, with no customizations.<br /><br />This is a powerful trap that works fast.  The cocking process may require more coordination and strength than some folks can provide. However, once the trap is armed, and the berm under the trigger is at the right height, you are virtually guaranteed to get your critter from either direction as it pushes dirt to close the hole.

However, the provided tools and proper technique make it easy.<br /><br />I had a dozen or more tunnels in a 15' x 25' area of my yard.  I picked one tunnel that seemed fairly straight, hoping it was one that was used over and over by the critter(s).  I set the trap, (which took less than 5 minutes), placed a bucket over it, and went back inside.  2 hours later I came back out and looked under the bucket.

      "I work as a groundsman and a large Seattle facility and was forced to take action to combat our mole problem.  Unfortunately mole trapping is illegal in Washington (damn liberals) but sometimes you have to bend the law!  The trap has a very strong spring as is more than capable of squishing moles with ease.<br /><br />Tips:<br /><br />Do not bother with the enclosed prongs.  The trap is easy to set if you use some creativity.  Drop the trap onto the grass (not dirt or pavement) and step on the jaws to get them shut in order to set the lever.  You have to use your body weight to do this.  Some people have said these traps are difficult to set.  They are a piece of cake to set if you do it this way.<br /><br />If the tunnel is on the surface, just use a knife (like a drywall knife) to make the slits in the ground and insert the legs of the trap.  Of course you will have to squish a small amount of tunnel down for the trigger to be right next to the earth.<br /><br />If the tunnel is a few inches down, dig a small section of the tunnel out (like 6 inches), place the trap inside, and fill it with loose soil.  The moles with try to make their way through the tunnel but will inevitably push up slightly on the trigger, causing their most unfortunate death.  Occassionally they will still be alive so be prepared for angry moles!  I will note that this is the #1 trap recommended by \"moleman\", just google the name.<br /><br />I have been trapping for about a month and have caught five moles so far.  Three big ones, two small ones.  Our grass is saved!\n",

      "Hallelujah!!!  The wicked mole is dead.<br /><br />For 2 years I have hunted this critter.  I have read the entire internet.  2 years of research led me here.<br /><br />For those of you with mole problems, let me save you some time.  Forget everything you think you know.  The only way to deal with moles is to kill them.  The only way to kill them is to trap them.  Baits don't work.  Treating for grubs don't work.  Moles primarily feed on worms, not grubs.  Sonic vibration thingys don't work.  These traps work.<br /><br />BUT...<br /><br />Don't follow the directions on the package.  I will do my best to explain how to employ this product.<br /><br />First of all, if you have to, stamp down all mole runs in your yard.  Ordinarily, you don't want to do this, because it just encourages the mole to dig new runs, thus doing more damage.  But you need a current picture of where the mole is active in your yard.<br /><br />The next day after you have stamped down all the runs, observe any new runs.  You are looking for long straight runs.  Long straight runs are like mole highways.  The curvy short runs are hunting roads.  The curvy runs are less traveled.  Hunt the highways.<br /><br />Open the trap and set the safety catch.  Set the trap down next to the run where you want to place it.  Take your foot, and stamp down the mole run just where you want to place the trap.  Should only be about your foot's width.  Don't push down hard.  You want the ground you stamp down to be level with the rest of the yard.<br /><br />Now take a straight blade shovel and create a notch on either side where the trap blades will go.  You don't have to go real deep.  Just a couple inches.  Wiggle the shovel if you have to, to create those \"pockets\" for the blades of the trap to go into.<br /><br />Carefully place the trap into the notches or pockets you just created until the trigger of the trap is level to the ground.<br /><br />Unhook the safety.<br /><br />It took me 3 days to catch my mole once I set my trap this way.  I moved it once after the first day because I wasn't happy about the run I had originally placed it. If you don't catch your mole after 3 days, then look for a better spot.<br /><br />Warning!!  If you go out to check your trap, bring a shovel and wear shoes.  When I got mine, he wasn't dead.  The trap had just got him in the back and he wasn't going anywhere, but he was alive.  So when you pull up your trap, go slow and be gentle.  You don't want to accidentally release him.  Be ready to whack him with the shovel.<br /><br />For 2 years this mole has terrorized my yard.  I was at my wits end.  My yard is destroyed.  Let the healing begin thanks to this product.  Now kill some moles!!<br /><br />EDIT 3-24-09: I just wanted to give everyone an update.  I got my third mole last night using these traps.  Add that to the 3 my parents have killed, our family alone is responsible for killing at least a basketball team of moles.  If anyone has any questions about how to kill moles, post or email me, and I am positive we can kill your mole too.<br /><br />EDIT 3-16-10:  I've been reading some other reviews here and I wanted to clear up some misconceptions and misunderstandings.<br /><br />First, if it looks like the moles are going around your trap, the most likely cause is that the trap is set too deep.  That ties to another reviewer who said they set the trap with the trigger at grass level.  That would be too shallow.  Before you set the trap, tamp down the run to GROUND level (not grass level).  When you cut the notches for the trap blades, and place the trap in the ground, the trigger should lay even with the rest of the ground.<br /><br />Second, while true that moles will eat grubs, their primary food source are worms.  Worms are usually more plentiful, and they move through the ground, thus making them easier to find for a hungry mole.  Grubs are more stationary.  A mole will eat them, but it requires more luck to find them.<br /><br />Third, if you don't get a mole in the first day, don't panic.  Give it a few days. Remember, the best place to put the traps are in the long straight runs. Those are the mole highways.  Just because it's a highway though, doesn't mean your mole will use that highway every day.  Give it some time.  It's not necessary to move your traps too often.  Even if your mole seems to be active in another area of your yard, if you picked a good spot to place your trap, he will come back and use his highway again.<br /><br />Fourth, moles are territorial.  There may be some overlap, but it's minimal.  HOWEVER, keep this in mind.  Just like you, moles prefer to travel along pre-dug roads.  You don't build a new road every time you want to go to the grocery store.  Moles don't like to either.  So, even if you kill your mole, it is VERY likely that another mole will move into your yard.  Keep in mind also, that the runs you see at ground level, are only a fraction of the amount of tunnels that might be running through your yard.  Moles don't hibernate.  They follow the worms in the winter, and worms dig in deeper during the winter.  For a mole to survive the winter, that mole has a whole labyrinth of tunnels deep under ground.  Easy pickings for another mole looking to move into your yard.<br /><br />EDIT 4-29-10:  Taught my boss how to use these traps and he got his first mole this weekend.  The moles in St. Louis are having a bad day!<br /><br />EDIT 5-28-10:  Got another one last night.  I've had a mole kicking around the area for the last few months and just couldn't get a good run to trap.  Finally, the idiot moved into another area of the yard, and to do that he had to make a couple long straight runs to get there.  Well,  that was his last mistake.  I had the traps in the ground less than 12 hours.  I woke up this morning to dead mole.  There really is nothing better with your Corn Flakes than dead mole.<br /><br />EDIT 7-22-10:  So about a week after I killed my last mole in May I got another one destroying my yard.  Took me 2 months, but that mole is now dead.  What a wonderful thing heavy rain is.  When it rains, it brings the worms up, and the moles are soon to follow.  Right into the waiting arms of the sharp teeth of my mole trap.<br /><br />EDIT 9-9-10:  Pics are up!  If anyone has any suggestions or questions about the pics, just leave a comment and I'll see what I can do.<br /><br />EDIT 9-10-10:  Less than 12 hours later, I'm the proud parent of a dead mole.  I kill more moles before 9am than most people do all day.<br /><br />EDIT 9-30-10:  Posted 3 pics that show how to prep the trap itself before setting it.  I also tried to label some components just so if there are questions in the future, we all have a reference for terminology.  I'm sure my verbage isn't right, but as long as we all understand the different parts, that's all that matters.<br /><br />EDIT 10-22-10:  There have been a number of commenters and reviewers that have asked about sandy/loose soil.  We haven't been able to give a very good answer because I don't have any experience in that kind of condition.  Another reviewer does though, and he did a really good job of explaining his technique.  The following is a link to his comments.  Thanks Bjay25.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />So it looks like Amazon won't hyper link in reviews, but just copy that link and paste it into another tab on your browser and that will take you right to Bjay25's comments.  That should be real helpful for people in the south that are dealing with sandy soil.<br /><br />EDIT 1-25-11:  Doesn't everyone hunt moles in the dead of winter?  I got my first winter mole last night.  I have all but moved in with my girlfriend, and after taking care of her yard last summer, we started noticing some mole activity.  Mostly in a flower bed, which is a tough place to trap.  I kept waiting for a good run to trap, but never got one.  Then winter came, and I kind of forgot about it.  I figured I'd get him next spring.  So then I was out taking down xmas lights, and the yard was TORE UP!  I tried stomping down runs, and was hoping I would get a highway to trap, but couldn't get a good one.  I finally got fed up, set a few traps and stomped down all the other runs.  About a week ago, it snowed pretty good here.  So the traps have been covered.  Yesterday was warmish, and the snow started to melt.  That allowed the traps to peek above the snow, and sure enough, the trap was sprung. I figured a kid prolly kicked it.  When I pulled it up, there he was.  In the middle of winter, on a day when we got freezing rain in the morning, I got a winter mole.  Remember, moles don't hibernate.  Usually they are deeper, to avoid the cold during the winter, but this one must have been desperate.  Maybe he thought he was safe since there was snow on the ground.  Wrongo buddy!<br /><br />EDIT 6-9-11:  This year is the hatch of the 13 year cicadas in St. Louis.  What does that have to do with moles?  Well, the cicada larvae emerge from the ground to mutate and mate.  What are they while they are in the ground and preparing to emerge?  They are mole food is what they are.  I've read a few articles now about the effects of cicadas on the ecosystem, and one thing that is consistent is that up to 2 years before a cicada emergence, mole activity is increased.  On the other hand, you can expect to see decreased mole activity after they emerge.  So, that might explain why so many in our area have been having mole issues.  Hopefully after the stupid cicadas are gone, some of the moles will go with them.<br /><br />EDIT 5-3-12:  I would love to talk to the 3 people who didn't find this review helpful.  I'm not gonna dwell on it, but I'm just sayin...\n",

      "<span class=\"tiny\"> Length:: 5:25 Mins<br /><br /></span>This is the way I've had luck using this type of trap. I've killed over 35 moles from my yard this way but keep in mind that techniques may vary depending on your area and soil type.\n",

      "This type of trap is highly effective IF you do NOT follow the directions about how to place it. If you bury it (which the directions will tell you to do) it will simply NOT work. If your \"out o sight\" trap is out of sight it is TOO DEEP and all you will get is holes in your yard and perhaps an annoyed mole.<br /><br />When the very expensive exterminator (who we now refer to as \"Mark the Mole Man\") came to our house, I showed him our \"out of sight\" mole trap. He tried to be respectful but finally just said, \"Ma'am, that's too deep. Ain't gonna kill nothin'.\" As it turns out, this is exactly the same type of trap he uses. He just knows how to use it correctly.<br /><br />He pulled it up and knocked the dirt off and walked around the yard for a while telling me stuff about moles. He clearly took great pride in his mole murdering skills (please don't give PETA my address.) Finally he stopped, stood silently for a moment, then he stepped his boot gently on a run until the soil was level with the surrounding soil. Next he took his special tool for making the slits that the previous reviewer described making with a shovel, and he made his two slits in the run for the blades to fit into.<br /><br />Then, artist that he was, Mark the Mole Man pressed the trap blades slowly into the slits he had made until the flat trigger was sitting gently on the soil. Released the safety and - Done. He placed three more in the back yard (BIG yard) and 24 hours later we had a dead mole.<br /><br />It was a wonderful (and for us expensive) experience. Go get your nasty little critter with this trap, but don't follow their directions. Listen to reviewer Geoffrey Klos.\n",

      "This is an excellent product. I had to play with the sensitivity of the trigger a bit before I used it. Once set, it worked very well. Trapped a couple of moles in 24 hours and problem has gone away now.<br /><br />I did not like the manufacturer's instructions. I had to find out how to set it myself. Here is what I did:<br /><br />1. Armed the trapped with the safety clip on.<br />2. Found a straight area on the mole's runway<br />3. Flattened a straight part of the runway a couple of inches wider that trap by stepping on it<br />4. Used a putty knife as wide as the trap jaws and cut two lines perpendicular to the run. I widened the cuts a bit for the jaws to push trough the cut easily<br />5. I pushed the trap jaws in the cuts until the trigger tip just touched the top part of the grass.<br />6. Removed the safety clip<br /><br />You can protect the trap if you are like me and have neighbors with kids and/or dog by covering the trap with a large bucket and a heavy weight on top of it.\n",

      "I admit it - I'm very, very ambivalent about harming any creature, even one that tears up our lawn the way moles do. But after one of our kids fell and nearly broke a leg in one of the numerous mole holes in our yard we (reluctantly) decided to cut down on the mole invasion. We did not want or need another emergency trip to the doctor's office. We also have elderly parents who visit often and the thought of THEIR falling was frightening to us.<br /><br />  Bottom line on these traps - THEY WORK. If you want a trap that quickly kills moles, these do. They also seem to keep  suffering to a minimum. I'm not even sure the moles DO suffer because I was walking to the mailbox and felt  one of these traps go off. The mole was dead by the time I pulled it out, less than a minute later.<br /><br />  Our lawn is no longer full of dangerous mole holes. I admit...if we'd only had an occasional mole hole, I would have stayed away from traps. We are animal lovers. We have pets.<br /><br />  But the situation was becoming dangerous. I didn't want anyone  to get hurt walking across our yard.\n",

      "I've had at least one mole terrorizing my landscaping for about 8 months now.  I initially let him go, since he wasn't actually damaging plants.  In time, though, he'd separated enough roots from the soil that I nearly lost several plants, and my 20 ft crabapple was dropping half its leaves in June.  Something had to be done.  I'd read the reviews here early on, but decided to try some control methods that I could get locally.  This trap was not one of those.<br />I used three of the Victor harpoon-style mole traps, and managed to get them triggered successfully, but the mole escaped.  The design is simply flawed--in pushing the harpoon downward, the trap tends to force itself out of the ground.  To help prevent this, the trap has very long stakes that need to be driven into the ground... if you have much gravel in your soil, like I do, this is nearly impossible.<br />Several states' university extensions have tested the relatively new gummy-worm style baits with reasonable success, so I decided to try them.  Because my moles \"highway\" tunnels were right next to my house under plastic, I was able to peel back the plastic and drop them right into the tunnels (the plastic made up the roof of the tunnels).  I checked them each day for two days and my mole was actually eating them.  I had to leave town for a week, and when I got back there had been no new mole activity, which was not normal for my busy guy. I figure the gummy worms did him in.<br />Unfortunately, another mole invaded about 2 weeks later--completely different habits, though--this one preferred the lawn over the landscaping beds.  I'd ordered these traps the same day I placed the gummy worms, so I set three Out O'Sight traps per the instructions given by other reviewers (NOT THE ONES PROVIDED).  In three days I had my new mole.<br />One additional method of locating active tunnels that I like to use is to poke a stick through the top of an existing tunnel that you suspect might be a \"highway\".  Place a stone over the hole to block out the light.  Check under the stone daily--if the hole is filled in, the mole has passed through again.  Set your trap there.<br />Given the choice, I prefer these traps over the baits for two reasons--no poisons in your yard to accidentally get your neighbor's cat, and there's a little mole body to confirm that you actually got him.  Just be prepared--the little critters are actually kinda cute.<br /><br />Familiarize yourself with their habits, follow the instructions given by the others here, and be patient, and you'll have your moles.\n",

      "As many other reviewers, I had tried pellets, castor oil repellent, giant smoke bombs (two packages), and a sonic mole chaser to no avail. Every morning during the summer I would surely wake up to fresh mole hills and pebbles on our front yard, and I was losing the war. Then I purchased the Out of Sight trap on Amazon based on reviews and because it was available through Amazon Prime. Also, surprisingly no mole traps were available at my local Home Depot and OSH stores.<br /><br />After placing the trap in three different locations over the span of a week, I finally nailed the bugger. Here are some tips that I learned on my own or from various sites on the Internet:<br /><br />(1) Many of the reviewers on Amazon said that they encountered only shallow mole runs that were visible on the surface. They cited a good technique to set the trap for the shallow runs. However, my mole burrowed only deep runs. No runs were visible from the surface; only the mole hills. To set the trap for the deep runs, I followed the directions on the box, which called for digging a hole along a main run. I had to dig around 6 inches to get down to the run. Then, just as the directions say, I created a \"speed bump\" and filled the hole with some very loose soil. Then I placed a large 39 oz coffee can on top of the hole and trap. In fact, the coffee can made for a good template to carve out the hole, which should not be much wider in diameter than the length of the trap.<br /><br />(2) I found out on some website (I don't recall which) that when you first get the Out of Sight trap that you should stick it in dirt for a couple of days so that the odor of the freshly machined trap metal, which the mole can apparently smell, gets diffused. I don't know if that is fact or fiction, but my first unsuccessful experience with the trap seems to support that theory. The mole kicked dirt into the hole where I first placed the trap and also plugged up the runs leading to the trap. Smart little critter!<br /><br />(3) I found that a good tool to locate the main runs was a weed remover. The tip of the weed remover is thin enough to poke into the turf, but thick enough to have you sense whether you are still poking through dirt, which may be loose, or have discovered a run. Keep in mind that the main runs are still only around 1-1/2\" in diameter. The key to placing the trap is to find an active, main run.<br /><br />(4) If you have deep mole runs (like I experienced), a good way to locate them is to draw a straight line between adjacent, new mole hills. There is a good likelihood that there is a run that connects the mole hills. Place the trap between the adjacent mole hills, but more than 18 inches away from either mole hill. If you place the trap within close proximity to a mole hill, you will invariably just get dirt thrown into the trap by the mole.<br /><br />(5) Once a mole is trapped, you may get another mole (or some other critter) moving into its place. Moles are individualists. They stay away from other moles, but take over a territory when there is no other mole present. Moles do, however, get together in the spring when they mate. So, even after a kill, stay attentive to your lawn.<br /><br />In conclusion, I attest to this trap and its quality. It should last a long, long time. I would not allow my wife or a child to use the trap, however. As others noted, the spring is heavy duty and takes a fair amount of strength and courage to set. Also, it can be dangerous, and a set trap needs to be handled very carefully and with the safety latch on.<br /><br />Now that I got my mole, I can wake up without the anticipation of me having to rake over mole hills and replug grass. Also, now that I am confident about using the trap (I have one kill under my belt!), I am assured that if another bugger shows up (and one surely will), I know how to effectively deal with it.\n",

      "I have recurring mole problems, lost count how many years now. Tried many things, but only this \"Out of Sight\" worked. This is my story:<br />1) First encounter years ago, surprise, what's up with these bumps?<br />2) Just tidy up the surface. Never mind that.<br />3) Ran water down the tunnel until water came out the other end. Very satisfying, but just a waste of water. Made the whole place muddy and the creature liked it even more.<br />4) Invested in a plunger type trap. Expensive and reusable, sounded good. Not quite. I was excited the first time it triggered, got my gloves on and plastic bag ready. The spikes went down a couple inches, but no catch. Tried a few more times with the same result. Even tied bricks on the top half, but the trap became unbalanced and did not plunge well. Trashed it.<br />5) Poison \"peanut\". Do not like poisons, but maybe just for this one. Carefully dropped nuts into tunnels as directed. No noticable result, but creature was gone late fall. Used it again early next season, at which time I concluded that it did not work. The creature likes worms and bugs, not deadly smelling chemical.<br />6) Wire type trap (like a rat trap). It fits inside the tunnel. Hard to use - the trap is directional and the tunnel must be disturbed for the deployment. My creature ran over or around it, never triggering it. The creature probably hit trap's frame and changed course. Would have been better if the trap is narrower and fits into a 1.5\" tunnel.<br />7) Saw it digging undergroud once (just once). Drove a pitch fork down mercilessly. Missed.<br />8) Lastly, the \"Out of Sight\". The size of the spring alone is impressive - WARNING: bone crushing spring force! Even my normally curious coworkers refused to play with it when my order arrived at the office. Set trap as directed the first night. At 3:30AM, a snap woke me up; continued to sleep, but with a smile on my face. The next morning, voila, face to face for the first time.<br /><br />I have a video of this last episode, may upload it later.<br /><br />Hints:<br />1) Creature likes wet area. It is most active right after watering. For the purpose of trapping, you can make a tunnel \"flavorable\" by keeing it moist between watering.<br />2) Creature works day and night, just not when you are looking.<br />3) Size your creature. Mine (I live in SoCal) turned out to be small like a fresh sausage. It explains why my pitch fork missed and the wire trap was too big.\n",

      "First of all, do not follow the instructions in the box. Instead read some of these reviews for very good tips.<br />I got two moles in about five days. It took me a little bit to learn where and how to set it. I pretty much followed the good advise given in other post, I recommend you do the same, their method works.<br />Before this trap I tried a bunch of less-aggressive methods but to no avail. It is really hard to get rid of moles in a nice way. Finally I got fed up and went for a trap. Also, with a trap you can see the body of the critter and know for sure that you got it.<br />The trap has a simple-but-effective design, it is built of solid, black-painted iron and it is bigger and tougher than what I thought it was going to be from the product pictures, but it is not huge. The spring is very strong and I have to put my weight on it (using the provided levers) to set it (remember to use the locking hook).<br />The triggering mechanism is simple and reliable, although I used a file to round the edge of the holding \"stick\" to make it slide out easier of the trigger piece (added sensitivity) but be careful not to over-do it! or it will trigger by itself.<br />The trap stays out-of-sight in my backyard because it lays low and it is black. I added a bunch of tree leaves on top of it to make it invisible. The leaves don't interfere with its functioning.<br />The most difficult thing about setting this trap is placement. I'm still learning where is the most likely tunnel that the mole is going to use. I'm using little construction flags to mark tunnels that I step on to find out which tunnels are the most active.<br />One if the moles that it caught was still alive when I checked the trap, so bring a shovel with you in case you need it.<br />Also the price is very good compared to other very expensive traps.<br />I highly recommend this trap.\n",

      "I have 3 different kind of traps -  plunger, choker and Victor out of Sight.<br /><br />I have never caught anything with the plunger but have had great success with choker and out of sight.<br />Geoffrey Klos' review is great but I had success burying the trap and here's how:<br /><br />1. Take knife and cut top off straight mole run the size of trap and set aside to replace turf later.<br /><br />2. Dig section out a little deeper than tunnel.<br /><br />3. Mound dirt up in center where trigger mechanism will sit on without setting itself off.<br /><br />4. Lay turf and spread loose soil around trap to fill in gaps<br /><br />5. The key is to put a bucket over trap so that there is no daylight.<br /><br />This method is a little tougher on your turf but if you cut it clean and use the bucket you should be able to put back with little damage.<br /><br />Best of luck.\n",

      "Update June 3, 2011<br />More mole activity which has now been stopped by a Victor trap. This time the activity was in the back yard including a flower bed. I decided to skip the test pressing phase and just selected a mole run, pressed the soil down and placed the trap. Sure enough the next day I had a dead mole in the trap. I had set two traps and the second one didn't catch anything so they are both back in the garage waiting for the next mole trapping adventure.<br /><br />Original review<br />Five hours after I set two traps I had trapped a mole; I was truly surprised to see one trap sprung and at first thought it must have accidently tripped; I pulled the trap out of the ground and there was a dead mole, the trap had done its job perfectly.<br /><br />I had lived at my house for over 30 years and this mole infestation was a first. When I started seeing the raised soil trails and dead grass I suspected I had somehow gotten a mole in my yard. I started reading everything I could find on the web and started getting free advice from friends.<br /><br />I called the pest service we use and the man suggested I buy the Victor trap as that was the one they used and the cost of them coming out and setting the traps could get very expensive. I read the Amazon reviews on the trap and they were generally helpful so I decided to buy the Victor traps.<br /><br />The general advice was to locate active runs by pressing down the soil that had been displaced by the mole which I did and then followed up with a hose to really flatten them down. Sure enough the following day certain trails had been raised up again and I selected one of those to place the traps.<br /><br />My yard has a sandy soil mixed with clay; it is also rather root infested so I followed several recommendations which said it was important to cut away any roots that might hinder the traps free movement. Before I placed the trap that caught the mole; I used a straight edged steel edger and pressed it down into the soil where the trap would be placed; sure enough I had to cut through several roots that crossed that area. I used my foot to press down the raised area where the trap would be placed.<br /><br />It took a little experimentation to finally get the trap set; I had never set a trap before so this was all new to me. It does take some pressure to set the trap; there is a safety latch which can be engaged first but then additional pressure with the tools provided is needed to actually set the trigger.<br /><br />I left the safety latch in place until the trap was set in the ground and I had pressed it down so the trigger was resting on the soil. Once that was all done I released the safety latch and the trap was ready.<br /><br />I covered the trap with a garden pot to keep the area dark and protect it from being disturbed by local cats and dogs. This was all done late yesterday morning and by mid afternoon it had trapped a mole.<br /><br />I will update this review if anything of interest happens. In the meantime both traps are in place waiting for the next mole.\n",

She's really good at digging huge holes in the yard....but not actually catching anything.<br /><br />As one reviewer wrote, \"You are looking for long straight runs. Long straight runs are like mole highways. The curvy short runs are hunting roads. The curvy runs are less traveled. Hunt the highways.\" This is so true!

I started setting them 3 days ago, and once I got the hang of it, I caught two in one day!  Bought three to corner them.  It's also nice because even though the product pic looks like it cuts the mole, it actually crushes it, so no mess.  They are hard to set. You need pretty good arm strength, but worth every second and penny.  Don't spend more either. I was tempted to buy more expensive ones, thinking, how could a $10 trap compare?  But no worries.

Read what Geoffrey Klos posted in his review and follow these instructions instead, then it's really easy to catch it (or them). Highly recommended item if you have a mole problem...<br />To find a good spot to set your traps, stomp everything down and wait a day. Watch where the earth is lifted up again, these are active tunnels. Try to find straight runs, these are called \"runways\". Anything else are feeding tunnels and they come through these only infrequently. A good indicator are actual mole-hills. This is where the deeper tunnels start (their living room, basically). The runways often extend from these mounds. Runways are also often found in parallel to obstructions, such as foundations, driveways or lawn edging. Those are also good places to set your traps.<br />Good luck hunting! :-)\n",

      "Our yard was COMPLETELY overrun with moles this year.  The lawn was dead and the trails were everywhere we walked--literally.  We tried sulphur bombs (the Giant Destroyer), spring traps, castor oil (lots of it), Talpirid (80 worms), sonic molechasers (13 of them on 3/4 acre--way more than was suggested), and finally a professional mole guy which cost us $450 to place poison bait (all we got from that is a sick cat and a $150 vet bill), but no dead moles.  Killing grubs doesn't work because their main love is earthworms and you definitely don't want to kill those.  Everything that you read says that trapping is the only way to truly rid yourself of moles.  They only reproduce once a year and usually have litters of 3 to 4 pups--and half of them die.  The only reason we get overrun by them is from not trapping them and using deterrents that only work for short periods of time, allowing their numbers to increase (from what I've read). I read about this product and all the great reviews and I chose to *believe* one last time, so I ordered 6 of them. We went outside this afternoon to set 2 of the traps and within 1 hour we had our first mole!!!  He was huge and very well fed, he lived a good life. RIP.<br /><br />Initially, we did get completely frustrated and we each threw one across the yard, then we calmed down and figured it out. The reviewers all had great tips and I re-read them.  The thing to remember is to set the trap and put the safety on BEFORE you try and put it in the ground (sounds obvious, but it seemed easier to place it in the ground first and it wasn't). The spring is VERY strong, but the metal bars they put in the package make it easy enough to open the trap with both hands, then hold it open with one hand, and keeping the plate near the ground for leverage, engage the pin on the striking plate and flip the locking pin over.  The only other hard part is finding the right type of tunnel!<br /><br />I'm convinced there is no \"natural* way to get rid of moles--I wish there was--but the only thing that is ultimately going to work is trapping them.  Be patient and don't give up, it really is easy to set this trap once you get the hang of it.  GOOD LUCK!<br /><br />UPDATE 11/2009:  Just caught another one this morning!  The trails are dwindling...<br /><br />UPDATE 5/2010:  Our grass finally grew back in after the moles killed every square inch of the lawn last year. We ended up getting about 5 moles. Just got the traps out again for the summer season as we noticed a small area being dug up.  We found a straight trail, set the trap and caught him within 4 hours!\n",

      "I have tried using these traps from time to time for over a year unsuccessfully.  But, after reading some of the reviews here for the other Victor Out O' Sight trap, I realized I wasn't setting them right.  And, I caught one mole yesterday, and another today.  So, I'm excited that I've finally come up with a way to catch them.<br /><br />I'm sharing my technique for setting them in the hope it will help you:<br />  1) Find an active tunnel.  You can just walk around the yard and step down on raised areas, then come back later and see if they get raised up again.<br />  2) Cut a couple of scrap pieces of wood that are 3/8\" or 1/2\" thick by four or five inches long, by say, five or six inches high. You'll use these to hold the grooves you cut for the trap legs when you push down on the soil.<br />  4) Get a garden tool that can cut down through any roots, like a hatchet, or a flat-blade tool with wooden shaft and a handle (don't know what you call it, but that's what I use).<br />  5) Get a tool you can use to find the center of the tunnel.  I use a discarded mop handle that I drilled a hole in the end of and glued in a six inch nail.<br />  6) Probe the tunnel to approximately locate it's center, and just leave it sticking in the center for now.<br />  7) Set the trap on the ground along the tunnel near where you will place it so you can see how far apart to cut the grooves for the trap legs.<br />  8) Cut the first groove for the trap legs as clean as you can; then, feel down in the cut line to locate the tunnel. Use a finger to locate the tunnel.<br />  9) Stick one of your scrap pieces of wood in this groove, and tap it down firmly.<br />  10) Then cut the other groove so the other legs will go in it.<br />  11) Again, run a finger down in this cut to locate the other end of the tunnel.  You do this because the tunnel may turn some, and you'll need to turn your trap too.<br />  12) Stick the other scrap piece of wood in it.<br />  11) Now, step down with your heel between the two pieces of scrap wood. You want this dirt to be very firm.  I do this, then also tap down with the end of my flat blade tool to get it extra firm.  THIS IS IMPORTANT.<br />  12) Next, wiggle the two pieces of wood back and forth, and in and out to open up the two grooves a little, them pull them out.<br />  13) Set the trap into the two grooves while observing the clearance between the ground and the traps bottom lever. You don't want it to contact the ground or you'll spring the trap.  Incidentally, you should have the trap safety ON at this point.<br />  14) Now, use a finger to feel the clearance between the ground and the lever; and, push and/or tap the trap down slowly until it is only 1/16th inch or so from the ground.<br />  15) Release the trap's safety.  I repeat: Release the trap's safety.  I seem to frequently forget to do this.<br />  16) Take some loose soil or leaves and just drop them around the trap legs to prevent sunlight from getting down to the tunnel.<br />  17) GOOD LUCK!\n",

      "Finally after trying about everything on the market for mole problems in the last 15 years I got lucky and bought this amazing trap. I adjusted and set the trap in the evening after recieving it, next morning I checked the trap and I had caught one of the moles that had been messing up my lawn and garden for about 2 years. I have tried gas, poison,and other traps, always without any known success. The give-away tunnels have always re-appeared.

      "In the past, I have used a metal type flea trap. I owned and operated a pet store and have had experience with several expensive methods of eliminating annoying fleas. This one works well. To end contamination, we just put it under our bed, and left it alone after vacuuming the carpet well. It ended the problem. To ensure that we were rid of the fleas, we purchased two traps, this one and the square trap you will also see advertised here as well. We have both going at the same time. One is going near the bed, and one underneath the bed. We have not seen a flea since installing these devices in our home, but, the traps are spotted with victims!!<br />Save yourself headache and frustration by making the purchase of two traps at once!<br />KittyKatKhan\n",

      "After battling fleas this summer and wanting to know if I had things under control, I purchased 2 flea traps, this one and the Springstar one to see which was the better flea trap.<br /><br />First, the light is very bright so if you plan on using this in a bedroom keep that in mind. It would be better suited to going under the bed.<br /><br />Second, the main difference between the 2 traps is the amount of open space for fleas to get trapped. This trap has a large open space to catch more fleas, and the Spingstar has a smaller grid that traps less fleas. The trade off is, the Springstar is more aesthetically pleasing. That trap hides the trapped fleas better under a grid piece, and kids and pets can't get to the sticky pad. With this trap smaller children could easily reach inside, so again, something to keep in mind.<br /><br />Third, when assembling this trap the sticky pad was curved in the box. This meant that the pad refused to lay flat in the trap. A small problem that could be fixed with tape if need be.<br /><br />Overall this trap is a good investment. I have had it set up for a little over a week now and have caught 2 adult fleas and gnats. This is a cost effective way to see if you have your flea infestation under control while not using chemicals. Since adult fleas can emerge from pupas months after an infestation it's far better to lure them to a trap to die then let them bite your animals.<br /><br />If you're choosing between this and the Springstar it boils down to a matter of personal preference. If you plan to leave the trap out for people to see, go with the Spingstar. If you want a large, industrial type trap, go with this one. Both caught pretty good amounts of fleas and lots of gnats.\n",

At 3.95 this might be priced right, but thats the price of the gluepads alone (which will dust in and get covered with cathair in a veru short time)(which were warped and bent and dont sit right in the plasic container because they lack a way to attach them firmly to the groiund). Or just build it yourself, should be possible too.<br />On a sidenote: Laughing about the guy that \"caught 10000 fleas\" with it.

So now I'm still getting one now and then but not as frequent as I was.  I've had this about a month (2 months after my family's dog first started having a flea problem).  Now it's starting to dissipate and the flea traps do help catch the stray buggers.  It does catch spiders, stink bugs, ants and a lot of other bugs too!

We also didn't want to use any pesticides, since we had four small house pets.<br /><br />When we moved to Michigan, we continued using the traps because our child was born, and we felt even more strongly about avoiding pesticides. Although we did not have a flea problem, the traps have caught several types of spiders, the occasional house fly, a few random creepy crawlies, and even a hornet! Basically, they seem to trap anything attracted to the light/heat.<br /><br />We keep them tucked away, out of sight (ex: in a back corner of our furnace room, under furniture), and in places where the pets can't get too curious -- getting a refill stuck to your skin (or dog fur) is the absolute worse.<br /><br />All in all, I think we've been using these traps for nearly ten years now. The bulbs can be replaced with regular night light bulbs or the new LED bulbs.\n",

In the daytime,<br />the dog is not in the room, the room is made dark, blinds closed,<br />door closed, from morning till night.  The trap gets about 3-4<br />fleas per day and after a month that sticky pad looks disgusting<br />and coated with fleas.  The key for me is to keep the room dark<br />during the day and keep the dog out of the room. The trap is the<br />only source of warmth and light in the room and attracts the fleas.<br /><br />This is a terrible flea season where I live, and nothing in the<br />yard, or frontline on the dog seems to help.  I walk my dog every<br />day so he will always pick fleas up.  In addition to the trap<br />I've tried nemotodes in the yard and wet down the dog and flea<br />comb them off my dog and drown those fleas in soapy water about<br />two to three times per week. I've also got diatomaceous earth<br />rubbed into his bedding.

I think it is most valuable in letting you know how effective your other efforts are, because if you have fleas, they *will* find their way into this trap. When I first started treating this season, I put this trap out. Overnight, it was covered in fleas, just like in the product pictures. As things started to get better, I noticed a decrease in how many fleas were being trapped. The last time I changed a disk, I caught several moths and such and one flea.

      "This is a review of the refills, followed by the same review as the trap.  The refills are easy to use, they come with a separate protective layer for each refill and it's fairly convenient to use the protective layer to cover the old, flea infested sticky trap when replacing it with a new refill.  Happy with the refills and the way they are packaged and installed.<br /><br />For the trap itself:<br /><br />I have 2 of these for 2 different locations.  Four stars instead of five because they do trap fleas; but they won't arrest an infestation. I use them as an indicator of the severity of the problem and whether I'm getting it under control.  Fleas are hard to see and find on carpet and furniture, not so tough to find on the dogs.<br /><br />The traps work best at night, don't seem to do much of anything during the day.  If I think I might have a problem or know the dogs have fleas I get the traps out.  This year we were successful with Siphotrol spray on the carpet and furniture and Barklogic's Lemongrass shampoo on the dogs (separate reveiws for those).  I count the fleas in the flea traps on a daily basis so I can tell that those measures are being effective, and when the overnight catch count goes to zero that's a good indicator the fleas are gone.<br /><br />If you are hoping the flea trap will cure an infestation by itself, there's a good chance you'll be disappointed. It might work, but I wasn't willing to wait that long.\n",

      "These traps are simply amazing - they take a few days to kick in, but they fill up quickly after that. I've had at least a hundred flies caught in a week, and it makes you think \"where did they all come from?\" (we live in a suburban area)<br /><br />YES, it does stink - the dead flies start to decompose, obviously, after a few days. While you *can* empty and re-use, I just throw it out with the garbage and use a new trap. For this reason, best put them someplace where you don't pass often (or eat close to!). This will also attract flies in the local area, so you'll see a lot of activity near the trap.<br /><br />It takes a few weeks of use to clear our the fly population, so buy more than one. I guess the lifespan of a common fly is about 2 weeks.<br /><br />Definitely worth getting - I try to buy a few at a time and use proactively.\n",

      "I've just installed the third unit in our garage or outdoors on a tree branch.  In each case, after a few hours, the trap is surrounded by a swarm of flies practically going frantic to get inside.  They are ordinary house flies.  The numbers are shocking - they must be coming in from all over the county.<br /><br />The plastic bottle, screw-on lid, and little roof are quite rugged and would probably last indefinitely.  The unit comes with a length of wire that works nicely for hanging it from a ceiling fixture or small tree branch.<br /><br />The bait is a powder that you mix with water.  The smell is quite foul, rather like - well, you know what flies enjoy sitting on most.  It's definitely for outdoor use, although with ventilation you might place it in the garage or shed.<br /><br />My experience indicates it is wise to empty the bottle before it fills up completely with dead flies, living flies, and maggots.  This will be a disgusting task and the stink will be formidable - not something you'll want to do near the house.\n",
      "672\n",
      "This trap works.  The bait smells a little like dead fish - really, this is a plus! Other traps I've used smell like strong, old, damp poop; I find that worse than old fish.  On top of that, the other traps I've used all have warnings on them attached to their bait - the Victor traps are made with food-grade material, and are non-toxic. they make refill baits as well, so I don't have to keep spending money on new traps. We use it in the yard where the dogs and chickens are, so inexpensive, non-toxic solutions are a must. The smell is dissipated outside, and I can't really smell much once it's outside unless I'm standing right next to the trap.  It takes about a day for the bait to start working - the instructions say to give it several hours - but once it's really activated, it catches hundreds and hundreds of flies in a couple of days.<br /><br />I'm very happy with Victor Fly Magnet traps, and so are the animals.\n",

      "I live in an urban coach house where the rear faces the alley. The alley is filled with trash, so as one might expect, I get my fair share of rogue flies in my house. I first tried the sticky fly tape stuff inside, and while it worked decently, it was more of a situation where it would catch a fly if it just happened to land on the strip. I still found myself killing more of them via shoe than the tape managed to catch. Not to mention having fly tape in your house is disgusting and messy. So I decided to try the Victor Fly Magnet outside by the garbage.<br /><br />If this thing caught 30 flies I would be satisfied. It caught, seriously, thousands. They are literally jam packed in it all the way to the top, and more are still trying to muscle their way in. I'm not only amazed by how well this trap works, I'm amazed that this many flies live near my home. My only question is, what do I do with it now? Set it on fire? Tape a grenade to it?<br /><br />In the 4 days since I put it outside, I have not had one fly in my house. Not a single one.<br /><br />Oh, and it doesn't stink that bad. The bait, when your mixing it in, smells like a barn or perhaps a dead fish. I can barely smell it when I'm standing next to the trap full of flies in the hot summer air.\n",

      "I live in an urban neighborhood and I hate flies so I'm starting to buy these things by the crate.  Everyone should use them, they work.<br /><br />Pros - I've killed literally thousands of flies.  Gallons of flies. Eventually I think I'll manage to wipe out the local breeding population and get ahead of the curve.  Trick is to start early in the spring - what one is really trying to achieve is population control not just killing a few flies.  Otherwise (depending on your landscape of course) the neighbors flies will just move in.  Bottom line if you use it according to the directions this flytrap works extremely well.  Many of the negative reviews here clearly didn't read the directions.  It really needs to be in sunlight.<br /><br />Cons - it reeks.  Seriously.  I can't imagine anyone using this inside their house - when it gets going you don't really want to be within 20 feet of it.  Unbelievably strong smell of rotting garbage. And though it's theoretically reusable, you are unlikely to do so unless you have a really strong stomach.  Think a big jar of rotting dead and half dead flies.  It's really foul.<br /><br />Bottom line, if you use it properly - think some form of perimeter defense, with targeting of fly hot spots like garbage cans with loose lids, you can make your world fly free.  If you have really few flies, one jar properly located will take care of them, but you should actually spend some time analyzing what you need.<br /><br />Anecdotally and by observation, btw, this seems like the most effective fly trap on the market\n",

      "The spectra paste food colors are simply fantastic. They provide a depth and clarity of color that is impossible to achieve with liquid food colors. And the hues are beautiful and distinctive. The black and red, two colors which are very difficult to get when dying frostings, etc. are especially nice - probably the best of any manufacturer I have tried.<p>For those who had questions, I am not 100% certain about the sizes, but if the set is the same as mine, the bottles are 3/4 ounce. While that might not seem like much, all you need is a dot of this thick gel paste at the end of a toothpick to color large amounts of material. So there is plenty of coloring ability in each bottle - many, many times more than a same sized liquid food color bottle. <p>Highly recommended and at a really good price at the time of this review.\n",

I am very very French in what I eat and how I bake and the products I need/want/use.<br /><br />Being a gel, you need less and the colours can be soft or bold.  If you are new to the gel I recommend using a toothpick to get a wee bit to mix in the dough, frosting, candy, cake, cookie you are making to better see if you actually need more.<br /><br />I love the violet for when I make my B&eacute;reng&egrave;re Abraham French macarons which calls for purple food colour to match the violet extract flavor.  Or green for when I make his Pistachio or  Kiwi macarons.

      "I'll admit it.  I am a food coloring novice.  For my entire life, I only thought food coloring came in 4 colors.  Bright red, bright yellow, bright blue and bright green.  If you wanted orange, you had to mix the red and yellow.  And if you accidentally added too much yellow, you had to add more red.  But then you could accidentally add too much red and have to add more yellow until you have a whole bowl of orange food coloring and all you wanted was to color a little bit of frosting so you could put it on a dozen cookies.<br /><br />Happily, I was wrong.  There aren't just 4 colors of food coloring.  There are at least 12.  And I bought them.  Not only did I buy them, I used them and loved them.  I little of this food coloring goes a long way.  Long gone are the days where you end up making gallons of coloring for a dozen cookies.  Gone are the days where you could never get the color just right without having to sand your table and rip out the grout of the tile on the floor because the coloring is everywhere after you tried to mix them.  These are amazing times where you open up the color you want and add just the right amount of exactly the color you were looking for.<br /><br />This is a great product and I highly recommend it to anyone who is looking to color their food.\n",

      "I have to start a course of chemotherapy; and my dentist recommended this gum to me to chew during the months I am on chemo. I am impressed with this gum because of its way of using natural enzyme protection to relieve dry mouth and protect your teeth from decay during cancer treatment.<br /><br />Oh yes, it's true--the gum loses it mild mint flavor pretty quickly--after just about a minute! However, if you want to protect your mouth during chemo, it certainly couldn't hurt to at least chew this gum some of the time. It beats getting cavities. At 44 I still have no cavities and I'm not about to start now!<br /><br />You do need to chew two pieces of this gum at the same time. One piece will be too small and you could accidentally swallow it, I suppose.<br /><br />The two pieces of gum have a total of five calories, so don't be concerned about that. It is sweetened with xylitol.<br /><br />Overall, this gum can save you from dry mouth and tooth decay during a course of cancer therapy such as chemo. It may work well if you need radiation therapy, too. It's not a fun type of bubble gum, (how I wish that it were) but it does what it sets out to do--protect your mouth from decay during a course of chemo treatment.<br /><br />Ask your dentist if you have any questions.\n",

It is also lots of fun to give to anyone who hasn't had it before.<br /><br />If you don't know what freeze dried ice cream is, it is pretty straight forward. All of the water is removed from normal ice cream in a special way. First the ice cream is kept frozen while a vacuum is applied to it. The vacuum causes water to slowly sublimate and vaporize. The vaporized water is eventually all sucked out and you are left with a chunk of ice cream that has everything in it but water. Note, it doesn't melt. The process brings water straight from the solid to gas. This technique is used for lots of foods because it makes the food last forever -- without water most bacteria and molds simply can't grow. If you are a hippie, feel safe. The process doesn't use any crazy chemical science that'll kill your mojo.\n",

      "I normally purchase the Lavazza Grand Crema pods for use with my Breville espresso machine, and have always been happy with them but wanted to try something different, so I ordered a box of Espressione Classic Espresso instead. Initially I was very disappointed with the results; a 30-second shot of espresso using these pods contained only about half as much liquid as one using my normal Lavazza pods (in other words, the water was passing through these pods at a much slower rate than through the Lavazza). Maybe my machine is lacking in pressure... but I could tell just by the feel of the pods that these are much more tightly packed than the Lavazza ones.<br /><br />My disappointment changed to delight when I tried these pods out on my Handpresso Wild, however. I had never really liked the taste of the Lavazza pods using this machine (seemed much more bitter compared to my \"real\" machine at home), but with Espressione it was perfect!<br /><br />Bottom line... if you are using a Handpresso, I recommend these pods 100%. If you are using a normal espresso machine, you may want to try out a smaller size package before committing to 150 pods.\n",

      "We ordered these to go with our new espresso machine and have been so pleased with them. We were really shocked at how delicious and tasty this coffee is - I bought it based on the Amazon reviews and they were right on. I decided these deserved another good review after I tried a Starbucks pod this morning and had to throw it out it was so terrible - it had no flavor and tasted watered down even though I made the correct amount (1 oz.) I have been lavishing praise on our espresso machine, which it does deserve, but I have now realized that the Espressione pods are the big reason that we've fallen so in love with our home espressos. The coffee is very flavorful, richly so. The price is also competitive when ordered in bulk like this, a great deal (these pods come out to be $.40 each whereas the Starbucks pods were $.41 each). They are certainly worth more.<p>One caveat, make sure to order the 100% Arabica pods - you would be well advised to always buy Arabica coffee as it is far superior to coffee made with the cheaper, more acidic Robusto beans.\n",

      "After years of using Starbuck's decaf and regular single serving espresso pods, I finally found a substitute that's more economical and MUCH better tasting.<p>I've used three different brands of pods in my Starbuck's Barista machine, and have found that the quality of the pod and the flavor of the espresso inside is, by far, the best in the Espressione pods. The flavor is more full bodied and stronger than in the Starbuck's pods. I actually use one pod to make two shots of espresso, and the flavor is more intense than when I buy my specialty drinks from Starbucks or other coffee houses.<p>Also, the pod itself is of very high quality. Each pod is individually wrapped in an airtight, hard foil wrapper, and I've never opened a package yet that contained a torn pod with coffee spilling out. Such is not the case with other lesser brands.<p>The tab on each pod is also handy, making it easier to switch out a hot spent pod with a new one when making a second round of espresso.\n",
      "896\n",
      "Both the 100% Arabica and the Espressione Espresso are excellent for espresso drinks. Traditionally espresso, unlike good drip coffee, is made with a mix of Arabica and Robusta coffees. The taste differences are noticeable, but I don't have a strong favorite. I use the pods for convenience, although I also roast my own green beans for espresso as well.<br /><br />If you look at the negative reviews, they're mostly on the \"best before\" dates being passed. While I would also be upset to spend money and get \"expired\" pods, I should point out that the pods are good for quite some time after their nominal expiration dates. I just found a handful of these Espressione Classic pods with 2002 (this is late 2009 now) dates and they made acceptable, though not spectacular espresso. Basically they're vacuum packed and not much is happening inside the wrapper.\n",

      "Looking at the reviews of this an other Vacuvin products, you see reports that are deeply contradictory. It's interesting that there is such a divergence of experience with such a simple product. The ideas behind Vacuvin are pretty simple.<br />First, air is the enemy of an open bottle of wine. Bacteria in the air want to turn alcohol into vinegar. The air itself oxidizes and dulls the taste of all but the most robust wines.<br />Second, you can remove some of the air with a simple pump and thereby slow down the rate at which wine deteriorates.<br /><br />Why then, do we have both no-star and five-star reactions to this product?<br />Maybe the biggest source of disagreement is expectations. Vacuvin slows the deterioration of wine in the bottle, but it doesn't stop it.<br /><br />Another possible reason for all the disagreement might be a question of temperature. The biochemical reactions that kill your wine are temperature sensitive. They proceed faster when the wine is warm and slow down when it's cool. Putting a pumped-out bottle in the refrigerator or wine cooler will slow down the spoilage processes and make Vacuvin more effective.<br />A third issue is the way the wine is handled before the Vacuvin plug goes in. If wine has a lot of air dissolved in it by being poured from decanter to bottle, there's no system that will keep it fresh.<br /><br />For more info on wine storage, check out my book, New Short Course in Wine,The<br /><br />--Lynn Hoffman, author of New Short Course in Wine,The and bang BANG: A Novel from Kunati Books.\n",

The most i've been able to get a red wine to last is about a week in the fridge, but that's 5 days longer than keeping it corked or on the counter! Sometimes a white has stayed in the fridge for 3 weeks and they're still fine. What i find interesting is that a decent to great red will over the 3-5 days i typically have it in the fridge, and it's sort of like aerating it each night.<br />I realize many people think vacuum stoppers or putting a red in the fridge is a no-no, but we have treated many cellar worthy wines and everyday wines through both steps and they come out just fine.\n",

      "I bought one of these wine savers for my husband and I a few years ago, and loved it so much that we bought one for everyone in our families for Christmas!<br />It's perfect if you just want a glass of wine and not the whole bottle! You can keep a bottle of wine for a couple of weeks or more, and it never tastes skunky as long as you follow the directions.<br />The only downside: The original saver I bought for myself came with a case for the parts. The ones we ordered for gifts came all loosey-goosey. Can be easy to lose the stoppers.\n",

After using it I bought 2 more to give away to my other wine lover friends.<br /><br />Edited Dec 14 2004: After using this product, I have to say it keeps the air out for about 2-3 weeks. I also like that the company made other items with the same air out idea like the marinater, and air tight containers. Keep in mind when purchasing that there are 2 differnt type of tops and one will not work on the other. The wine saver also can come with another top so you could have all of the same tops. I believe the other wine saver may be an older model.\n",

      "Trident White makes a terrific peppermint flavored sugarless gum. The sugar free gum is healthier for your teeth; and the gum makes your breath fresh in an instant. The thin cardboard package is easy to carry because it is so small; and inside the thin cardboard package the pieces of gum are wrapped individually in tiny plastic pockets that are easy to open. The package states that the gum whitens teeth but I cannot comment on that. Always remember to brush your teeth--this gum isn't a substitute for that!<br /><br />A single piece of gum has nothing more than a measly five calories; and there's no fat, no sodium and no sugar. Trident White uses sorbitol and aspartame to sweeten the gum. Moreover, the gum stays fresh until the expiration date stamped on the reverse of the package. Good job!<br /><br />Unfortunately, there are a couple of caveats: The gum contains a milk derived ingredient and it contains phenylalanine. If either of these ingredients pose a concern for you please consult your doctor before chewing this gum.<br /><br />Have further questions? No problem--the manufacturers give you both a toll free number and a website. The website goes into detail about how this gum helps to whiten your teeth.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great gum that comes packaged in an easy to carry container. This gum makes your breath fresh; and it's a very tasty gum that you won't want to spit out after a mere five minutes.<br /><br />Highly recommended.\n",

I like the variety of instruments the band employs(violin,banjo,steel guitar & sitar etc) are some of the instruments used in the cigarettes & carrot juice collection.<br />Even though I only heard my second CVB track when I bought this collection in late 2010, It does'nt really matter as unique, lively & colorful music such as this loses nothing over time.Don't know if they have ever toured Australia,but it would definitely be on my list.\n",

      "Finally, a collection of the best Camper Van Beethoven albums (I think there is one album missing from the band, a  major label release with intentionally clean over-production).  I had been waiting years for this dream CD, as I only possessed each one in vinyl.  <p>Some people like to listen to a full album that has a recognizable identity in its sonic experience.  You will not get that from Camper, as they instead offer a faint, mysterious familiarity in musical pieces that can tweak your ears in two opposing directions, even during the simplist compositions.  If that sounds appealling, you can correctly guess that boredom cannot maintain a presence with this compilation.<p>Categorizing this music is impossible, again due to so many style changes.  Psycho-country?  Unpretentious garage-rock with arena-sized talent?  Low-fi Hillbilly Jazz?  Spraycan Art-rock?  Gritty Underground Surf? Poor rich kids with Mischievous Aspirations transferring their energy into music? Kerouac whack?  How about calling it a \"Flexible Soup\".  It's anything but smooth, yet occassionally you find David Lowery's penchant for small club-guitar rock sneaking through (after CVB dismantled, he became the leader of the successful pop-rock group, Cracker).  It may be easier to instead think of the band as a group of hyper-static fellows whose medications are almost, but not quite at the right dosage.  They're simply possessed by friendly demons with a spiritual intent to entertain and cause wonder. <p>Each album collectively draws numerous inspirations and styles, completely entertaining the listener through lyrics and musicianship on a variety of traditional and obscure instruments.  One can only imagine the pure enjoyment the band had while first writing then performing these before an audience.  For two decades now, I've held a relentless belief that CVB would make the most amusing backyard-party band -- sure to make Granmma Nelly dance alongside her pierced third generation of family one moment and then cover her bleeding ears when the next song begins.  However, I believe the band's intent is not to frighten or shock, but to instead expose the wealth of musical styles that one listener despises while another reaches a glee plateau.  Be sure that these same two listeners will switch positions when a later tune begins.  Are you prepared to enjoy the best of many worlds?<p>Picturesque landscapes are lyrically drawn with a slacker-like intelligence in unimportant poignancy, the next moment you are drawn into a global hoe-down, followed then by crafty psychedelica mixed with raw instrumentals, closing with an guitar orchestra jamout with lead played by a screaming violin chant.  Add a half-tablespoon of sugar Wiseguy and serve.  <p>Add this to your collection if you appreciate bands that are like no other.  Some tracks will prompt you to ask \"Why?\", yet with an immediate second thought you'll smile and say \"Why hasn't Anyone Else?\"<p>[I noticed that CVB had recently made a handful of live performances after a long time apart.  I've caught several of their shows and recommend all to give your mind a jolt of electricity that is surprisingly pleasant.  You will walk away wide-eyed at the unrealized potential and wasted energy we swallow in 99% of today's music. ]\n",

      "Long live Camper Van Beethoven!! This is a blessing for long time CVB fans who didn't have a chance to upgrade their collection to CD before most of this went out of print.  Wow, where to begin?  CVB was a band that matured on record, so to speak, so this is really a fascinating and entertaining listen from beginning to end.<br />  Of course you get the endearing and humorous debut album with goofy anthems ala \"Take the Skinheads Bowling\" and various folk/ska instrumentals; the increasingly warped and psychedelic \"II & III\"; and this collections' centerpiece: the self titled 3rd album!!  Forget the editorial remark above about them \"scratching their heads out loud\" on this because there's nothing confused, unfocused, or tentative about this album.  I'd say it's a characteristically irreverent and eclectic psych-rock masterpiece.  The song writing has fully matured with the sarcastic humor still intact, and it seems to be intentionally conceived as an album that gets stranger and stranger as it goes on, with the group mastering every diverse style they apply themselves to.  I could go on and on about this album, but suffice it to say it's a classic.<br />  \"Camper Vantiquities\", the 4th CD is a top notch odds and ends collection containing perhaps the best Camper song ever: \"Seven Languages\" and the Harrison/Starkey composition \"Photograph.\"  Finally, the live CD is a competent but not revelatory live set from 1990 with 2 songs from 1988.  I would've prefered to hear an earlier and more chaotic live recording, but I'm sure the quality wouldn't have been as good.<br />  All in all, you can't go wrong with this.  The packaging is quality: a thick , bright orange box with the 5 Cds in simple glossy slip cases, (well, the box is relatively thin but it's made of nice thick cardboard) and a full color booklet with 2 essays.  One is an entertaining first-hand account of what Santa Cruz was like when Camper formed; the other is a dry and factual journalists view on the Camper \"phenomenon\" MUCH LIKE THIS REVIEW.

      "This kibble has been the staple diet of my 80 lb Great Dane Mix (named Kobe) for the past year. He came to me two years ago from a rescue group who transports black dogs from the southern U.S, where black dogs have a very high kill rate, to the nortern U.S. to be adopted. He was about 5 yrs old at the time I adopted him, sight unseen, from Arkansas.  Severe alleries were included among the miriad of issues that afflicted him. This manifested itself in runny eyes, full body skin yeast infection resulting in what the vet termed \"elephant skin\" on his abdomen, throat, elbows, and haunches.  Also bald spots over his neck, throat, thighs, and toes from constant scratching and biting at himself. In many places the \"elepant skin\" was perpetually split/cracked, infected, and bleeding.  After treating the bacterial and yeast infections with both topical and oral agents which did clear up the bacteria but left the yeast as a chronic secondary infection of the allergies, I searched for other remedies.  Along with seasonal, environmental, and other allergies to dust, fabrics, vegitation, etc. I also found a lot of good information about food allergies.<br />Taking this information into consideration I scouted around for an \"allergenic\" kibble that was made by a company that has never had a recall, does not do animal testing, provides appropriate nutrition, and is somewhat affordable. Wysong seemed to fit the bill. Anergen has been a key part of Kobe's allergy treatment program for the past year.  Along with \"therapeutic baths\", Ketokonazole lotions, hydrocortisone lotions, diligent laundering of doggie coats/bedding/linens (no wool), and oral antihistamines Kobe's skin is soft and smooth without splits/cracks/infection; his bald spots have shrunk to half the size; and his eyes only run occasionally.  He still does scratch and bite at himself intermittently. I notice this usually happens when I deviate from the Anergen diet, giving him rawhide chews, beef bones with marrow, or cookies (organic) with mixed ingredients.<br />I don't really know what else, short of steroids, can be done to help him. I have avoided steroids due to their own detrimental health effects. Anergen seems to be the food solution to his allergies, which is a good thing! I add water to the kibble and let it sit about 10 minutes to form a kind of \"gravy\".  He likes this better than the straight dry kibble and it also helps to keep him hydrated.<br />Note: My other dog, a 9yr old husky-shepard mix eats Wysong Maintenance and is strong and svelt; and the cats eat Wysong Uretic.\n",

      "Unlike the previous reviewer, my cats like the Au Jus cans.  They enjoy the chicken, turkey, rabbit and duck flavors.  I like to feed my cats a high-protein diet to keep them trim, and this food helps me reach that goal.<br /><br />The only reason I'm giving the food 4 stars instead of 5 is because you can't feed it alone.  It doesn't have the vitamins cats need as a standalone food.  It's good for a meal a few times a week or top-dressed with supplements.  I also wish the Au Jus varieties came in the smaller cans.  It's hard for 2 cats to go through a huge can in a couple of days.<br /><br />If you're feeding your cats grocery store foods, they probably won't like this.

I was experimenting with food since the cats are almost 1, and I wanted to introduce different kinds of adult food so they'd get used to them.  I mixed half Science Diet dry kitten food with this product, and the cats began to eat less.  I was worried about how much they were eating (nearly 1/4 their original diet) so I filled one bowl with this indoor cat food and one bowl with their kitten food.  They barely touched the indoor cat food, while eating most of their kitten food.  I ended up having to mix some canned cat food in with it to get them to eat.<br /><br />Part of it might be that the food is triangular and much larger than the kitten food.  They had a hard time eating it at first, since they were used to the small pieces of the kitten food.<br /><br />Don't be discouraged, though.

      "This is a really good choice for a nutritionally sound, lower calorie food, and our cat (admittedly not picky) immediately devoured it. But the real message here is: you need to find out how many kcal/day your cat needs for weight loss, research the calories in your cat's food, and accurately measure your feeding. There do not appear to be industry standards for what's labeled as 'weight management', 'light' etc., and the differences are dramatic!<br /><br />Our very young and energetic cat starting piling on weight from when he was a kitten. Maybe he stuffs himself because he's a 'rescue'--I don't know whether he might have had some starvation in his early weeks that marked him for life! but we had to put him on adult food before his kitten year was up, on the advice of our veterinarian--and he went on to gain weight up to almost 20 lb. even when giving the recommended daily amount of food, measured, divided into 2 daily feedings.<br /><br />We decided to switch from a Purina Pro Plan regular adult formula to their 'weight management' formula--still, kitty was gaining. When I finally did the research of how many kcal/day he should be getting and how many kcal we were giving him (mind you--the recommended, measured amount), I was shocked. The packaging recommends 56-84 g./day of the food for weight loss, for a cat with a goal weight of 10-14 lbs. That's 214-321 calories, measured by their own nutrition information. But my research at [...] showed that the recommended amount should be 187 calories/day for weight loss, for a goal weight of 10-12 lb. That means the *minimum* amount recommended by the Purina label was 27 more calories/day than he should be getting--or 14% more! and the maximum 'recommended' amount was 72% more than he should be getting for weight loss.<br /><br />[...] has a publication with calorie counts/cup of a wide variety of cat food: [...]<br />The range of calories/up is staggering. Anyone with an overweight cat--do your cat a favor and research how many calories/day they *should* be getting, and how many calories the 'recommended' amount that you're feeding actually is.<br /><br />After finding out how much of the Pro Plan Weight Management per day to offer, I thought our problems were over--I started giving him a daily amount with the right calories for weight loss. And he did start losing, at a slow but safe rate: about .2 lb/week. But he was constantly, frantically hungry. I looked further, for a nutritionally sound food that could give him more volume and fill him up while still not exceeding the calories he would need for weight loss. With the help of [...] for nutritional ratings, and the calorie chart on [...], I selected Science Diet Light--with approximately 75% of the calories per cup compared to the Purina Pro Plan. I can now give him 9g/day more, and I think the higher fiber content of this food will help him feel more full. While it does cost more than his previous food, the difference is not going to break the bank--I estimate it will cost me $4 more per month.\n",

Sure, you'll see stories of how one person's cat had issues, but even if that's 100% true, it's 1 case out of millions. Science and fact aren't based on someone's experience.<br /><br />So my point is, I love my cats and I'm very concerned about their health. I trust people who actually have medical degrees and experience with a wide range of animals. My only caution is do not fall for some hype or scare tactic that recommends some unproven or untested food or some fad diet for your pet. Don't listen to me, don't listen to the negative review.

The vets were unable to diagnose any parasite or physical problems, and his behavior has always appeared happy and healthy.  The vets said it could be a food allergy, so I began trying different foods.  A couple of months ago, I bought SD Sensitive Stomach.  I had been reluctant because of the ingredients - I strive to avoid foods with \"meal\" of any kind - as well as the price ($40 for 15.5 lbs).  After a year, five other foods and several supplements, though, I was desperate.  Sensitive Stomach did the trick.  There was a noticeable difference within a few weeks, and the stools are completely normal now.  His weight gain has been constant regardless of food, so I do not attribute that to the Science Diet brand.<br /><br />The drawback is that my other two cats prefer this food to their original brand, so it's quite expensive for three cats.

Cats loved it over all the other 'meat only' brands...<br /><br />Only problem was... soft stools...  Talked to the vet and she said that sometimes cats need some form of fiber, even if it isn't nutritious, it helps to bulk up the stools and get rid of the God awful odor...<br /><br />So went up and down the food aisle and this particular brand/version had the highest fiber content of all of the bags of food.  The BWC food has 3.5% fiber... This indoor cat food has 10% fiber... yes it is indigestible corn... that's the whole idea... a form of roughage to helps the bowels.  This food also has added fiber on top of the corn stuff etc...<br /><br />So I'm going to see if this helps with the soft very stinky stools... if it does, I'm sticking with it.<br /><br />So far the cats haven't seemed to mind the larger kibble size.

      "The vet showed me that my 14-year-old cat's teeth and gums were in bad shape. Her teeth were stained and layered with plaque. Her guns were bright red along the edges. She had Gingivitis. I was facing a $300+ teeth cleaning bill for the cat. The vet recommended I try Hill's Dental Diet first. After two months of eating it, the cat returned to the vet. The large, hard nuggets had cleaned the plaque from her teeth. Her gums were no longer red, but pink and healthy. Hill's did what was needed. I am thrilled with the results.<br /><br />Yes, this food is expensive, but so is a teeth cleaning bill for a cat, as well as dental problems if you don't. Once my cat's mouth improved, I cut back on the Hill's. I feed my cat a main diet of Purina dry, but I still give her 8-10 Hill's nuggets a day. She's been on this mixed diet for one year and her teeth and gums are still good and healthy. The Hill's large nuggets act like a tooth brush that scrapes against the cat's teeth.<br /><br />Pound per pound this cat food is actually less expensive than those little bags of tarter control cat treats you buy in the supermarket. Once you get control over your cat's dental problems you can maintain her by giving her several Hill's Dental Diet nuggets a day.

      "Ok cats, you can stop wiggling and showing me your lovely bellies, and get up and play.<br /><br />Let's get down to the nitty gritty. Hill's Science Diet Adult Hairball Control Dry Cat Food does what it says it does and MORE!!!<br /><br />Now, I DO feed my cats wet food, so I give them Hill's Science Diet Adult Hairball Control Dry Cat Food as a TREAT and a SUPPLEMENT -- and it is powerful stuff!! To be graphic, let's just say that Big Bad Baby Twinkle's poops used to look like small rocks, no matter what I did for her food (and she loves her daily hairball gel too) -- but NOW after feeding her even a small amount of Hill's Science Diet Adult Hairball Control Dry Cat Food (twice a day after she eats her wet food) one look at her litterbox and I think that a German Shepherd has visited the litterbox. To say that this makes me happy may sound wierd but now I KNOW that \"stuff\" is moving THROUGH her intestines and not getting impacted or staying inside and creating toxins.<br /><br />The same for Cee Cee kitty -- she, who is daaainty and small (BBBT weighs twice as much as Cee Cee and is twice as long as Cee Cee), also pops out some big ones now. I am happy -- yes I am -- this means their intestinal transit time (from eating to pooping) is shorter and they are healthier for it.\n",

      "We have a 8 month old LabraDoodle and he loves this food. Prior to trying this food we tried several other brands, a few times Raja ate the food but threw up a little later. Even on the Science Diet brands we tried other variations like \"Lamb Rice\" formula and he did not like that at all. He would rather stay hungry than eat other food. There is something about this \"original\" formula.<br /><br />One note: make sure you keep the food in a sealed box, in cool dry place, as per instructions.\n",

      "I don't use small cans like Fancy Feast, so I cannot comment on those. However, I like these because they LAST. I bought them at a pet food store which no longer carries them, probably because they are so expensive.<br /><br />Except for a lid I bought at least 15 years ago labelled Sargeant's, these are the sturdiest. The more flimsy ones always end up getting a crack in them and are not always tight.<br /><br />For me, the 4 stars, not 5, is because they seem expensive. However, on Amazon, it seems that most of the can covers are more expensive than you would want to pay. It's the S & H that is outrageous.\n",

      "I have a puggle who chews all of the time, and she has been through a variety of Nylabone products, all of which she absolutely loved.  I am a huge fan of anything Nylabone, and when I saw this one, I immediately had to get it for her because not only did it look like something she would love, but the design promotes good dental health.  She has had it for a month now, and she is constantly chewing on it.  Not only has it helped to keep her teeth clean, but it is much more durable than other Nylabone toys.  She chews it every day, carries it around and drops it all over the place, and it has barely worn at all. I highly recommend this toy for dogs who love to chew!<br /><br />I do have to share one negative to this toy though.... if your dog likes you to \"tug\" with them for their toys, this one isn't for you.  It hurts to grab and pull on it.  Not much of a negative, but I want to give a fair review, so if you are looking for a strong tug toy, go with a smooth surfaced large Nylabone and save your hands some pain :)\n",

      "This dog toy has been a huge hit at my house. I just added a bulldog puppy to my family and if he is awake his teeth are constantly seeking something to sink into. This toy is hard enough to hold up but not so hard he loses interest. The irregular shapes are great for giving him multiple chew spots on this toy. This dinosaur has even brought out the puppy in my 8yr old mix that was never big on chew toys.<br />Can't go wrong with this one!\n",

      "Okay, I had to speak up. Hello, common sense and directions on toys. ONE) choose a toy that is large enough to encourage dogs to chew using their side/back teeth. You DO NOT want a toy that is small enough for dogs to use their front teeth or likely they will crack their front teeth, ect. So even if the toy says is is meant for large dogs, pay attention to how your dog chews on it. If they're chewing with their front teeth, take it away and try the next size up. TWO) Yes, toys sometimes do say for powerful chewers. If your dog is tearing off large chunks of the toy, TAKE IT AWAY. DO NOT LET YOUR DOG KEEP IT THEN ACT SURPRISED THAT YOUR DOG IS HAVING DIGESTION PROBLEMS. Nylabone toys are meant for dogs to take off tiny slivers at a time, no bigger than a grain of rice. I don't care what \"strength the chew toy is\", if it's not strong enough for you dog, take it away and try a larger/tougher toy.<br /><br />All of this is common sense, but in case that escaped you, it's also on the directions.\n",

      "I have a beagle/jack russel mix. Needless to say, he is very high-energy and does best when given a job to do that involves chewing.<br />He LOVES his Novabone and Nylabone- but tears thru the larger sizes in a single afternoon- so when I saw this I was very happy, because it is an unusual shape and durable! Amazon's iphone app let you scan in an item and find it cheaper on Amazon- so instead of the higher pet shop price, I scored a savings deal on Amazon! Nice!<br /><br />My big, fat, sad complaint is that you cannot CHOOSE the dinosaur! I knew this when ordering and the stegosaurus arrived- honestly I was hoping for the T-Rex or the Brontosaurus but I guess you get what you get. Still, a beagle gnawing on a T-Rex would be pretty funny...\n",

      "I have a dog with very strong jaws. She's only thirty-five pounds but she goes through most toys like they're bubblegum. Even as a small puppy, she would destroy anything and everything. By the age of five or six months we had to give up on soft and rope toys altogether, and at a year old, she is limited to only hard chews like Kong, Nylabone, etc. Even then, she destroys most of these with relative ease. She's gone through chews others have recommended as long-lasting in literally ten minutes. The only toy she has that has lasted more than a month or so is her original red Kong, which she mostly licks instead of chews.<br /><br />I initially bought the dinosaur for my other, less toy-murderous dog, but the power chewer quickly stole it from him. She was in love. She carried it everywhere and chewed on it constantly. I'm not sure if it's the shape or the texture she likes, or some combination thereof, but whatever the case, it instantly became her favorite. Even the most durable hard toys normally only last a few weeks with her, but her dino is going on two or three months now. It's chewed beyond recognition, all the nubs worn down, and it's very rapidly nearing the end of its life because little bits of plastic are falling off, but it still lasted far longer than most toys do. A few weeks ago I bought her a second one, in a different shape, and she's equally as enamored with it. All in all, it's not going to be indestructible if you have a power chewer, but it certainly lasts a heck of a lot longer than most!\n",

      "I have a 15 month old puppy who is a powerful and destructive chewer.  I discovered Nylabone toys a few years ago when my cocker spaniel, who was an anxious chewer, had to have intestinal surgery to remove parts of a rubber toy.  When I got this puppy I gave her a stuffed animal and 5 minutes later I had to throw its remains away.  She has been a Nylabone girl ever since. She loves her dinosaur; she carries it everywhere with her and even sleeps with it.  It no longer has a recognizable head but she did not manage to chew off any large chunks, just little bits.  The downfall is that I find a lot of little rice sized bits of dinosaur in the furniture and her blankets; the up side is I know there are no big chunks of toy ending up in her intestines.<br /><br />I highly recommend this and other Nylabone \"for powerful chewers\" type toys to anyone whose dog is a little chew crazy. I also recommend buying from Amazon because the price is about half of what it is in the pet store and the selection is much better than discount stores have. At the price for these dinosaurs I am getting ready to order a few more so that when the one we have is worn out I have another readily on hand.<br /><br />For reference my dog is an oversized Jack Russell Terrier (around 30lbs) and this toy is the perfect size for her.\n",

      "I am a long-time dog trainer and rescuer. I've owned all the versions of this indispensible toy! The Stegosaurus version held up - for years! - through Australian Cattle Dog, Border Collie, English Staffordshire Terrier, and Irish Wolfhound puppies. They even chewed on them as they got older.  I wouldn't recommend Tyrannosaurus (too many gaps to crunch on) and Brontosaurus (the tail eventually breaks off) if you have dogs like mine who have huge jaws and teeth the size of my thumb. If a toy lasts at my house it truly is almost undestructible.<br /><br />As with any toy, don't leave your pup alone with it until you've watched to see they can safely chew it. Do examine it regularly to make sure there are no cracks. Unlike most Nylabone bone-shaped toys, my dogs prefered the shape and texture of these. I usually start them off by rubbing a bit of peanut butter into the nubs the first time. After that the dogs carry them around while teething.  Best of all, they wash up great in the dishwasher!\n",

She's a 3yr old Coton de Tulear a rare breed which are in the bichon family My dog is very hyper & has nervous energy she doesn't know what to do with, I thought getting her a chew toy would keep her busy for a while, but they didn't even last for a day. I went on line and read reviews from other's reviews on different chew toys, when I read the reviews for this dinosaur chew and read their had the same issues my dog had and their dogs were a lot bigger & weighed more then my dog is small& weighs 15 lbs. I thought this chew would be a perfect chew toy & it would last for a longer period it has lasted & she is still chewing on it after 4 months. This is going to be a second dinosaur chew I am buying for her as a backup. She loves this toy and I would recommend this for those pet owners who have dogs who are heavy aggressive chewers this will last a long  time.

I decided to buy one for my husky. It's one of his favorites often played with. It is a hard thick plastic toy with some weight to it. My dog and my sister's dogs, they all have chewed the crap out of it to the point it doesn't look like a dinosaur anymore! Oh and they constantly carry it around with them and drop it on your toes. Ummm yeah OUCH!<br /><br />The one drawback (and warning) of this toy is that the teeth marks left in it can cause sharp or rough edges. Some fragments are chewed off and left on the floor.

These chew toys are one of the rare exceptions and best of all, my dogs go bonkers when they get these toys.  Hours and hours of chewing enjoyment and they pick the dinosaur shaped bones over their regular Nylabones every time!  I think they especially love the unique shape and the bumps must be soothing on their gums.<br /><br />The only downside is that little tiny particles can break off - so you'll want to watch for that.  I suspect this wouldn't happen if you have a mild/medium strength chewer.  However, if you do have destructo-chewers like mine, know that the little specks that break off are no where big enough to be choking hazards - they just make a little mess on the carpet after a hour chewing session - so that means vaccumming after they're done chewing and removing the toy after it becomes unrecognizable as a dinosaur.\n",

One of those was the dental dinosaur durables.  He LOVES LOVES LOVES this toy.  And after 4 months it is now time to replace it (the head and tail are now missing).

My dog seems to prefer the shape of the Brontosaurus to the T-Rex. I think this because he will just chew on the T-Rex, but he actually plays with the Brontosaurus. Also, I have two other dogs that are older (around five), and they won't touch these toys unless they are playing with the young Lab.<br /><br />Sidenote: At Walmart, I have found the Hartz Chew'N Clean Dog Bone Country Bacon Flavored Large.

She has a new dino and is very happy.  We tried other chews but they don't have the nubs on them which she seems to enjoy.  I purchases back up dino's in case we ever lose one again.

It's his favorite chew after the Nylabone Edibles (he's a little glutton) and he can spend hours chewing on it from all angles.<br /><br />He wasn't so keen on it to start out with, but a little playing (hold it out and then pull it back- not mean just to get him to chase it) has turned it into one of his favorite toys.  It's durable, easy to clean and the shape is quite engaging.  He can manipulate it, chew on the various limbs and carry it all around the house.\n",

My boy cat, Boo, is a bit pickier about what he plays with and looses interest after 10 or 20 minutes. My Poxie girl will play with anything and will play as long as you let her.<br /><br />Boo likes watching and chaseing the catnip bubbles but dislike it when they pop (because then he gets squirted with wet/cold liquid .. even if it's tiny droplets). Poxie walks into the shower and isn't as picky about getting her paws wet so she goes crazy for them. So, Poxie will play forever if you let her and Boo gives up after a while, which is normal habit with most toys anyway :)<br /><br />I adopted both of them from the pound (a year and half apart) and both were noted as being more skittish than \"normal\". Both of them don't like a whole flurry of bubbles drifting down on TOP of them and will startle or run away every once in a while. So, when we play and it's been a while since I brought out the bottle, I start as low or eye level to them as possible (but don't blow directly in their faces) until they get used to the bubbles.<br /><br />I'm giving this four stars simply because the liquid \"may cause stains\" on carpet. So you might want to do a test swatch if you have really delicate fabrics. If your 'nip loving cat startles easily and doesn't like water (not that bubbles popping really is that bad?) then it's probably not the toy for them.

They investigate spots where the bubbles touched the floor, they maneuver around for the best spot to see the bubbles fall, and if I close the bottle and put it away too soon, they try to pull it off the shelf themselves.<br /><br />A previous reviewer brought up doubts about the authenticity of the catnip extract, but I suspect her kitty may be a connoisseur. This may not be the good stuff, but the bubbles are now off-limits in my apartment after 7:00pm because fifteen minutes after bubbletime, my duo start ricocheting off walls.<br /><br />As for how the humans like it, I've experienced no staining of furniture or rugs, but the smell IS pungent and will stick around.

This diet, IMHO, is very appropriate for cats that develop struvite crystals and require a more acidic urine.  I cannot speak about this diet for cats that develop oxalate crystals.  Talk to Wysong and your vet before making the switch if your cat tends to develops only oxalate crystals or both struvite and oxalate crystals.\n",

      "Both my cats have a good quality dry food as their main staple, but enjoy sharing a can of Fancy Feast a day; it makes their peaceful lives more interesting, and gives them that extra motivation to wake me up in the morning.<br />Gourmet Seafood Feast is their very favorite flavor, but others that rank high are Fancy Feast Gourmet Chicken Feast and Ocean Whitefish and Tuna Feast.<br />The flip top can makes it easy for their sleepy mom to serve breakfast, and the smell though fishy is not bad at all. Perhaps it might do with some sour cream on crackers if your run short on canap&eacute;s during your next cocktail party.<p>The can states that its main ingredients are Ocean Fish, Liver, Meat By-Products, and Fish Broth. There are many other ingredients of course, as well as vitamin supplements. The can also states that Fancy Feast Seafood Feast &quot;Provides complete and balanced nutrition for the growth and maintenance of cats&quot; and recommends 1 can per  3 and 1/2  lbs. of body weight, and reminds us to &quot;Refrigerate unused portion&quot;.<br />Whether served in crystal or the plain white ceramic bowls my buddies Liddy and Mushka get, your cats will love Fancy Feast, and will thank you with satisfied purrs.\n",

I considered that there was a possibility the food may have had a \"sliver of bone\" or some such contamination and stated this in my review, because my two cats previously liked this food. TURNS OUT that she has an allergy to who knows what (not this product I'm sure) which has made her mouth sore. The vet said it is common even in young cats and suggested it could have been caused by grass or plants she may have eaten during her short little trips out into the yard. So I am recinding my previous poor review and suggest that you buy this product if your cat likes it. Also this is a reminder that all \"Reviews\", although well intentioned, are not always correct.<br />Happy shopping to all!\n",

We tried a few different brands and flavors. They'd eat it for a few days, then turn up their noses. Even expensive food from the vet's did not please them.<br /><br />So, we tried the Friskies Sea Captains Choice flavor, and they went nuts, gobbling it down like candy. We only bought a few cans at a time, figuring they would tire of it, but no, they have been eating it with gusto for a coupe of months now, so we buy it by the case.<br /><br />I don't understand about it not smelling good; perhaps they got a bad batch, but it smells like other cat foods to us, and the pate is easy to dish out.

      "I must agree with the first reviewer, as I've never once seen any feline of any age show anything less than enthusiasm for Purina Kitten Chow. I purchase at least one on these seven pound bags per month, although my youngest are now approaching one year of age. Many people (myself included) avoid commercial cat foods, but I've had some truly great results with Kitten Chow over the years.<br /><br />I don't think of Kitten Chow as \"for kittens only\". No doubt there are people who will disagree, but I've observed the benefits of feeding to older cats or kittens who are either malnourished, recuperating from a surgical procedure or are outdoor, feral cats who refuse to allow humans to touch them. This is what I bought and fed a young female cat who arrived on my front porch last winter, cold, starving and frightened..and, as I realized about a month later, when she'd gained weight and bone mass, very pregnant. Initially, I hadn't expected this cat to survive, but she thrived.<br /><br />Then I feared that if she succeeded in giving birth to a litter, her kittens might be weak and have a less than optimal chance for growing to adulthood. Wrong again! She got through the birth like a champion and each of her four kittens are healthy and happy (all, including the Mom cat have been spayed or neutered). Her diet and then theirs, until they were weaned: Purina Kitten Chow, a Cat Mother's Milk supplement and chicken or turkey (human) baby food. The Kitten Chow remains as part of their regular diet.<br /><br />The feral outdoor cats benefit from the extra nutrients and fat content. I often wonder how these poor critters survive sub-freezing temperatures and have built a few small shelters to keep them out of the wind, rain and snow that I've no evidence they use (back to the shelter drawing board for me!), but Purina Kitten Chow is food they adore and eat and I'm convinced it has helped these cats survive (and one I was able to humanely trap and have neutered and vaccinated before releasing him back outdoors ~ his definite preference ~ survived the surgery and the winter cold, an attack by another feral and territorial cat and now appears quite healthy).<br /><br />I could be a snob about this as so many people seem to be: if a product is commercial, it isn't trustworthy or truly good..but I've seen a lot of recalls of very expensive high-end guaranteed organic kitten and cat foods and Purina Kitten Chow did not seem to make it to the recall list. When I believe a feline needs even more nutrition than this food provides (a RARE occurrence), I typically resort to DIY recipes where there is no issue with Quality Assurance.<br /><br />Honestly, this food is not only a favorite with cats of all ages, but I believe it is also a lifesaver. It's great that Amazon has made this product available, as it saves me a 50+ mile trip into town and a lot of running around miles of a \"Super store\" to be able to receive it via USPS at regular intervals. Now that these kittens are *technically* cats, it might seem less than optimal to feed them Kitten Chow. Still, I continue to incorporate it into their diet. The only reason I could imagine NOT to make this food available to your kitten or cat is if they appeared to be overweight..and mine (who live entirely indoors) aren't. They're in terrific shape! They all have exquisitely beautiful and healthy coats, lovely clear eyes & zero GI problems. They prefer the Kitten Chow to Purina's \"All Ages\" Original Formula and if you feel any concerns you can always mix a percentage of both together as an extra incentive ~ and those of you for whom price is no object: it's good to keep a bag around when your cat refuses to eat the high end Prescription Diet.<br /><br />Again, this is the food of choice IMO for feeding feral outdoor cats..particularly when you cannot afford to buy the really high end food that isn't necessarily any better (and is potentially far worse). In case you're concerned about longetivity: I've had a cat who lived to be nearly twenty years old who was entirely a Purina Kitten and Cat Chow cat who was healthy right to the end of his considerably long (indoor/outdoor..before I had the wisdom to learn that keeping one's cats indoors 24/7 was the kindest, safest way to go) life.\n",

      "I have two Burmese cats, and both of them are being or were raised on this kitten formula (one is 13 months, the other is 8 months).  They have been on it since they were 4 months old.  I did a lot of research into food recommended by my breeder since we spent a lot of money on the cats.  I ultimately decided on this brand because of the research they have done.  I plan on putting both of them on the Persian formula (that is for Himalayans and Burmese too) because these types of cats are prone to getting a certain type of UTI and need their urine a different pH.<br />Their fur has never been softer, they are so active and always chasing each other, they are very playful with us.  We always comment on how soft the older one is, just like a pillow, and the younger one is getting closer every day.  They eat the food I leave out for them every day, so I'm assuming it is satisfying.  I just love this brand and plan on sticking with them, even when we get dogs.\n",

That initiative will give them the gift of a longer, healthier life, eliminate many chronic health issues that pets face, save you money in vet bills in the long run... the list of benefits goes on and on.<br /><br />I have done extensive research on canine and feline nutrition and I highly recommend, if you are going to feed commercial food, Welless, California Naturals or Innova. For a great complete meal, I give my dogs all one of those dry foods mixed with a little bit of canned from the same brands, water for hydration, a touch of a good quality essential oil (such as olive, flax, etc.), a touch of powdered kelp and alfalfa, a splash of organic apple cider vinegar, Prozyme digestive enzymes to unlock the nutrients in all that good food and top with a dollop of plain yogurt. It sounds like a lot, but it takes me less than 5 minutes to assemble the meals for 6 dogs - and they are ridiculously healthy an full of energy, even our 3 seniors who are 11, 12 and 13. I have two seniors with heart murmurs and at our most recent vet check, my dog with the worst heart murmur, a 12 year old beagle that I love desperately, had a 2-grade improvement in condition severity - that is HUGE.

Also, all the ingredients are apparently from the U.S.A, so no worries about melamine (the two recent melamine scares were from Chinese wheat gluten and Chinese milk powder).<br /><br />We're on our 3rd bag now - my girl thrives on it, and likes it.  She's hard to keep weight on, but this food is good for that as it has a very high energy content compared to most kibbles.<br /><br />I do feed partially raw & partially kibble,  not just Canidae, so perhaps that makes a difference to how well the dog does on it.

      "I know my review is a little out dated from its earlier posts but, I love this food for my 2 labs.  I have never fed them anything else.

I know you can buy a 44lb bag, but that doesn't fit in my container.<br /><br />I started feeding this about 10 years ago to one of my other labs because he had cancer and I wanted to give him the best nutrition possible with out breaking the bank.  He thrived on this food.  He has since passed and now I have 2 more labs.  My labs are 7 and 5, and I have not heard of any change in formula, nor have I ever fed anything else.  I do remember a dog food recall a couple years back where dogs were getting very sick due to a contamination of sorts, but Canidae was never part of the recalled list, as far as I know.  I know all about gas, I have labs, no matter what you feed them they have some sort of gas.  I do not feed my dogs table scraps and use Milk Bones for treats.  As far as I am concerned a little gas is fine as long as it is coming out and is not stuck inside, that is when it becomes a problem.  All mammals have gas, it is a fact of life, to think you can prevent dogs from gas is crazy!<br /><br />I feel terrible for the dog owners that had sick pets.

Not only do I know that they will eat it right away but it produces a lot less poop. With all the other kinds of food we would see it just sit there for hours and hours. Plus, Purina gave them the stinkiest, biggest, most icky poop.

      "Oh my goodness...I have an 11 year old pug/beagle mix that has been lethargic for about 3 years, wouldn't really play, had a dull coat no matter how much I groomed her, and has had itchy paws and armpits for a long time. I never knew that all of that crap was in the big name brand dog foods. I had always had her on Purina of some sort until I started doing research. I was blown away by what I read and quickly became obsessed with finding a better food without paying an arm and a leg. I refuse to pay more for my dogs food than for our own food. After researching about 30 different dog foods and prices and brands on different websites, I went with Canidae All Life Stages (chicken, turkey, lamb, and fish)via Amazon with free super saver shipping for both my 11 year old Puggle and my new 10 week old labrador retriever puppy. I haven't regretted the change or the purchase at all! I am absolutely thrilled. My 11 year old isn't nearly as itchy, has a crazy shiny coat now, and has ALL KINDS of energy to keep up with the puppy now! Also, the breeder of my new lab had her on Purina Pro Plan Large Breed so I switched her right away and even her coat looks so much better now and it's only been about 3 weeks. I can't wait to see the difference in the two of them over the next 3 or 4 months. They both did get a little bit constipated during the transition period from their old foods to the Canidae, but a little bit of canola oil for a few days drizzled over their breakfast and dinner fixed that until their bodies adjusted. Both are regular now with no problems. Also, during the transition, I couldn't get either of them to eat even one piece of their old food. They would both pick out the Canidae and gobble it up and then leave their old food in the bowl until they were later famished! It was funny to watch!  Great product, great service, and will definitely continue to order the 44 lb bag via Amazon. The packaging was very very poor but that's a different issue. The box that the food was shipped in wasn't even big enough for the bag and the UPS driver brought me the food, with pieces of the box laying on top of the bag.

Also, each day, her coat seemed less shiny, she had a ton of dandruff, and scratched like crazy.  After only a week on Canidae (I'm gradually mixing more and more of it in, and decreasing the Eukanuba)-- she's stopped itching, and her poop is way more solid and far less frequent.<br /><br />I know there's no perfect pet food, but if you have a dog with a sensitive stomach and/or possible allergies (I'm thinking corn or another filler that Eukanuba and Iams uses?), Canidae could be a godsend.

Your item will be delivered a week from the date you ordered.\"  And sure enough, it arrives within a week of ordering.<br /><br />**Original review**<br />I feed my dogs the Canidae grain-free All Life Stages food (now called Canidae pureElements, I don't think Amazon has updated the photo or name of this food yet but the ingredients haven't changed) - why the Grain Free variety?  My younger sheltie has epilepsy.  Gluten and corn are possible seizure triggers, so I feed both my shelties a wheat, corn, & gluten free diet.  Canidae is only part of that diet;  I feed them 4 small meals a day - 1/4 cup Canidae Grain Free ALS, then a 4\" piece of raw turkey neck, then veggies for the last two meals.  The last meal is sometimes another 1/4 cup of Canidae instead of veggies.  I know, it's complicated, right?  But my dogs really do better on a mostly raw diet like this.  I still use kibble because it's the fastest way to feed them a meal first thing in the morning before I let them out to go potty.<br /><br />I've fed a variety of kibbles from the natural pet food shops, some with grain and others grain free, and when I fed them an all-kibble diet (Canidae or other brands) my younger sheltie had TERRIBLE gas, while my older sheltie had anal gland problems where she'd have an anal sac blowout at least once a month.  So gross, but that's why we covered our couches in blankets that were easily washed.  (Gosh I hope you're not eating lunch while you read this review.)  Anyway, I started giving them more raw food and the gas has disappeared and my girl sheltie no longer has anal gland issues.  Their teeth are cleaner too.<br /><br />I didn't want this to turn into a \"raw food is the only way to go\" preaching session, I swear!  But for my dogs, raw is better - it's easier for my younger sheltie to digest so he doesn't gas us out of our home, and it gives my older sheltie firmer poo so her anal glands work like they're supposed to.  Canidae doesn't help my dogs' particular issues like raw does.<br /><br />However, Canidae is a heck of a lot easier and cheaper to feed, and my furry kids certainly do love Canidae's taste, they inhale it.  If your dog doesn't have weird kibble digestion issues like mine do, then Canidae Grain Free ALS is a 5 star dog food.  For my dogs' sensitive systems, it's a 4-star food.<br /><br />The Canidae Grain-Free All Life Stages has a 34% protein level, which seems to do better with my shetland sheepdogs' stomachs than the higher protein kibbles.  I've fed another brand of grain-free kibble (Innova EVO turkey & chicken) that had 42% protein which was too high for them to handle even when switching to it gradually and only getting a 1/4 cup a day... 42% protein made their poo liquid.  So, I've stuck with Canidae's grain free ALS.<br /><br />I've also done a 50/50 mix with the Grain Free ALS and the Grain Free Salmon, the furry kids love it.  The Salmon variety smells like FISH, big surprise, right?  I try not to breathe when dishing it out, don't care for the smell of fish like the pups do.<br /><br />As I write this, Amazon's price is the same as my local natural pet store.  As much as I'd like to support local business, my local natural pet store is terrible (it's a long story), so I buy Canidae here on Amazon.<br /><br />Ingredients:<br />Chicken meal, turkey meal, lamb, potatoes, peas, chicken fat (preserved with mixed tocopherols), lamb meal, ocean fish meal, tomato pomace, natural flavor, choline chloride, suncured alfalfa meal, inulin (from chicory root), lecithin, sage extract, cranberries, beta-carotene, rosemary extract, sunflower oil, yucca schidigera extract, dried enterococcus faecium fermentation product, dried lactobacillus acidophilus fermentation product, dried lactobacillus casei fermentation product, dried lactobacillus plantarum fermentation product, dried trichoderma longibrachiatum fermentation extract, vitamin E supplement, iron proteinate, zinc proteinate, copper proteinate, ferrous sulfate, zinc sulfate, copper sulfate, potassium iodide, thiamine mononitrate, manganese proteinate, manganous oxide, ascorbic acid, vitamin A supplement, biotin, niacin, calcium pantothenate, manganese sulfate, sodium selenite, pyridoxine hydrochloride (vitamin B6), vitamin B12 supplement, riboflavin, vitamin D3 supplement, folic acid, papaya, pineapple.\n",

      "I have a Goldendoodle and felt he was a little on the thin side, so I started researching dog foods. I found that what he was on, was not really good for him. The second ingredient was ground corn and I found out that shouldn't be in the dog food at all. It's all filler, non-digestible...filler in, filler out. Through this surfing and sifting of information, what was good, explanation of terms, and eager for any information I could get and then pursue, I ended with Canidae All Life Stages Dry. There were others under consideration, but considering cost, balanced with good nutrition, supplements included in the food, and availability, I opted for Canidae.<br /><br />Of the top five ingredients, before the fat (in this case chicken fat), three are animal protein meal, Chicken, Turkey and Lamb meals. The other two ingredients are Brown and White rice, good easily digestible grains. My understanding is dog food is weighted and the ingredients listed based on that weight prior to them being reduced in the cooking process. Meaning when your ingredient list - lists chicken first, that is precooked weight. After cooking the water and some of the nutrients and calories are lost in the process and if the same ingredients were measured for listing after cooking, the ingredient list would not come out looking as good. Chicken might not be as high in the list. If a 'chicken meal' is listed, they start with the same grade of chicken, generally speaking, however meal is weighted and listed after it has been cooked down. This is the same for any 'meal' protein. A 'meal' protein is just the protein you end up with after it is cooked down, the water cooked out of it. So a 'meal' protein in the ingredient list is a good grade meat protein, which won't be reduced by the processing of the ingredients together. Five lbs. of chicken, may end up to be 4lbs, however 5lbs of 'chicken meal', stays 5lbs.(this is made up example for clarity, not based on any math or science). The ingredients go on to list additional herring meal, vitamins, probiotics (for good intestinal health), natural preservatives and supplements like amino acids and calcium to name a couple.<br /><br />Beforehand, Riley was less than excited about meal time. He would pick at it almost from the beginning, walk away, come back - a little more eating and allot of drinking. Now, he eats it.<br /><br />A big benefit and another part of the reason for a search, is the reduction in feces. He was going 6 or 7 times a day and no small amount. We are down to two - four times/day so far. Improvement in condition of feces also. Firmer, more normal coloring, less of it. It seems like his body is getting more out of his food.<br /><br />He seems to have an improved activity level. His playfulness is increased, but not hyper by any means. Just healthier? perhaps. Calms right down on command, even around the other dogs.<br /><br />So far so good for this change. I have read that poor results can happen after weeks or months of a change, but so far so good. He doesn't shed, so I'm watching carefully for any new hair loss. I won't wait it if occurs, I will take him off. I certainly would say, conditionally, this is turning out to be a good food for my dog and would suggest it to others looking for a quality food.<br /><br />** It's been about 2 months now on Canidae.  Riley is still looking good.  No sudden hair loss, healthy, energetic, eating as I type...Still happy with this decision, and am still using it.\n",

      "I started feeding my dogs Canidae All Life Stages Dry Dog Food almost 5 years ago. Prior to that I used NutroMax. Wow, what an amazing food. My german shepherd and 2 golden retrievers have the most incredible coats. Their poops are firm (and easy to pick up) and nearly odorless. No allergies either, unlike most of my friends whose poor dogs suffer from all kind of food or skin problems. I've convinced one person to change to Canidae and she too is very happy with how well her golden is doing on it. I buy it locally as I go thru 40 pounds every 3 weeks (feeding 3 large dogs). I highly recommend this food, could not be happier.<br /><br />Update: Canidae moved their manufacturing to a different plant in late 2008 and at the same time, in order to save money, changed their formulas. Added a lot more grain and other products that have caused dogs to have numerous skin and GI problems. The organization that oversees pet food standards has received more complaints about Canidae than any manufacturer in recent history, due to their formula change. A fried of mine owns a pet supply store and he says he is getting about 50% of the Canidae bags back from owners w/ pets having problems w/ the new formula. All 3 of my dogs had bad reactions, and I even did a gradual change over because I was told ahead of time (by my friend) that they changed the formula. Diarrhea, vomiting, itching, scratching. My one golden scratched himself raw to the point I had to take him to the vet. After using Canidae for many years, and recommending it to many others, I decided enough is enough and got rid of all of it. I switched to using California Natural Lamb and Rice and Orijen Adult, two all natural foods produced with the highest quality control available. Both company control the ingredients, manufacture the food, have numerous quality checkpoints, and do their own distribution. My dogs are different ages and have different needs so I do a blend of the CalNat and Orijen and  WOW, what a difference. Their coats are shiny, their energy levels are great and poops are solid and virtually odor free. And they love it! Both are great foods, a bit more expensive than other foods but to me, worth every penny. Cal Nat and Orijen are the best foods you can buy in my opinion. If you are considering Canidae, I'd recommend you look at Cal Nat or Orijen instead.<br /><br />New Rating:<br />Canidae - 0 stars<br />California Natural - 5 stars<br />Orijen - 5 stars (I'd give Orijen 10 stars if I could, it really is that good).\n",

      "I work for a veterinary hospital, and after the big food scare I found myself calling around to different food companies to see who made an AMERICAN product. And by American, I didn't mean imported products thrown into a food assembled in the United States so it could be called \"made here.\" I wanted meat grown here, veggies grown here, and no imports. FOUND IT.<br />This dog food was recommended to me by a bloodhound breeder. Bloodhounds are known to have gunky skin (must be all the wrinkles) and they are prone to eye infections, allergies, bloat, and numerous other conditions. Well, most bloodhounds. Not her dogs. Her dogs have healthy glowing coats, shiney eyes, and just bring her lots of ribbons in the show ring.<br />My dogs are couch potatoes, but I feel better feeding them something good for them. At first I was worried the smaller bite size might interfere with good tartar control, but now months on this food NO TARTAR. At all, and my one dog had had a tartar control problem for a long time. His doggy breath has never been better. If I could give this food 10 stars, I would. I'd recommend this food for toy breeds as well as giant breeds.<br />It used to be when I opened a bag of food I'd keep my nose away because the dog food was stinky. Not this food, now, I'm not saying I want a mouthful, but it is NOT stinky like some dog foods. You can actually smell the herbs they use.<br />This product is on my wish list at Amazon. Anyone who wants to get me a good gift, get me a bag. It is definately a gift I'll use!\n",

      "My 20-month-old Toy Fox Terrier mix has been eating Canidae since I adopted her and changed her over from Science Diet, so I don't have an amazing transformation story.<br /><br />However,<br />1. She's only been sick twice to speak of. No unexpected need to go outside NOW or accidents in the house because of illness. What comes out of her is as predictable as the sunrise, albeit somewhat less pleasant overall.<br /><br />2. This 12-pound, high-energy dog eats just under 1 cup a day. A 40-pound bag lasts me about 6 MONTHS, which calculates as less than $7/month for food. Canidae may cost more than better-known brands, but it's a bargain for the improved nutrition and related benefits (see 1 and 3).<br /><br />3. It never occurred to me that it could be because of her food, but it's true she has basically no smell, as others have mentioned. She's in every way glossy, happy, clean, and puppy-like.\n",

      "My dog was sick for 2 months and lost 20% of her body weight. Her coat was falling out in clumps and she was still barely eating, eventhough the vet couldn't figure out what was wrong with her. We switched her to Canidae based on a friend's recommendation. She has gained half her weight back in 2 weeks and her coat is improving, as is her energy levels.<br />For a siberian husky, this food can't be beat!\n",

      "I have been using this food for 4 years since I read raving reviews on many sites. I was looking for a reasonably priced food which was better in quality than the cheap chain crap. I didn't want to pay $2 a pound for a high quality food and Canidae was just right for my budget and quality needs. My dog loves it (but you can't really judge it on that alone as he is a lab and will eat anything) however his coat is nice, his stool is the right consistency, and he is hardly ever ill. He also NEVER EVER has gas (but he does burp from time to time but not smelly like others have mentioned.) I wasn't happy when the price increased and the quality supposedly dropped a bit but I am still happy with this food overall and have continued to use it. I am always on the lookout for high quality food at a reasonable price so if anyone knows of something high quality at around the same price point please respond to this post and let me know.<br /><br />On a different note, was I the only person who actually DID hear about the formula change before it was too late? When I went to purchase more food and saw that the 40lb bag was discontinued I went looking for a reason why and to make sure there weren't any other issues. Right on their website it mentioned the formula change, bag change, and the proper way to transition your dog from the old to the new food to avoid digestive issues. As I had 1 full bag of old formula left, I followed the instructions and guess what, no issues whatsoever with the transition. My dog did NOT get sick at all and has not had a single problem with this food new or old formula.\n",

      "I have been researching dog food for a few years now.  I am living in Japan (US Military) and I was ordering my dog food from PetCo online.  I have tried Solid Gold Hund N' Flocken, DVP's Natural Balance, Costco Kirkland Super Premium, Eukanuba FP Prescription Diet, and Hills ZD Ultra Allergen Free Prescription Diet.<br /><br />I was able to source the Canidae and the Solid Gold foods locally for my Dal with serious allergies.  Both of the foods have had better results than the super pricey prescription diets.  I am sold on Candidae.  I pay $[...] for the 40 LB sack, which is not that bad considering I am sourcing it locally on the Tokyo economy.  The dogs love this food more than the Solid Gold, but I believe that they are both fine foods.  This food looks tastier than the Solid Gold Wolf Pup that I was feeding my K9 German Shepherd, and it seems heartier that the Hund N' Flocken as well.  It just looks like it must taste good.  The dogs go nuts over it like a crack addiction!  I am very happy that I have found a solution that is applicable to both dogs!<br /><br />There is something to be said of companies that go the extra mile for our man's best friend.  It is just not right to feed our pets the crap that they sell in the stores.  I used to think that Eukanuba was a great dog food.  Thank God for the Internet!<br /><br />Buy this food, you will not be disappointed!\n",

      "The only reason I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 stars is for the strange can design -- a substantial amount of food sticks to the inside of the can and in the crevice under the top lip, long before the can is empty, and I have to use a baby food spatula to scrape this off.<br /><br />That being said, Cee Cee kitty devours this. It is not grain free -- as it does have Brown Rice in it (listed as the 8th ingredient, so it DOES have plenty of meat and fish protein), but the meat as well as the other ingredients more than make up for this. Felidae Canned Cat Food for Adult Cats and Kittens, Formula with Chicken, Turkey, Lamb and Ocean Fish  also smells very fresh and not garbagey like some of the supermarket cat foods. And since Cee Cee is battling hyperthryoidism as well as a heart murmur, I want to buy her the best food I can afford. This may be a bit pricey but it is VERY dense, so it goes a long way.\n",

      "It was brought to my attention by a friend who owns a local pet store that many of our three cats' problems -- weight gain, shedding, and inability to hold their food down -- were undoubtedly a result of their diet of Meow Mix. So 2 weeks ago I picked up a bag of Precise on her recommendation, and the difference in the cats is astounding.<br /><br />Their energy instantly improved. Even our old, lethargic cat started playing again. As active as they now are I am sure their weight will improve as well.  Their coats have a new shine and the shedding has been reduced drastically. As for holding down their food? I have not had to clean up a mess in 2 weeks!<br /><br />I was concerned that the price per bag for 6.6 ounces of food might stretch my budget, as it is a bit more than your average grocery store/Wal-Mart cat food, but what I have learned is that with a diet rich in vitamins and meat (not just by-products) the cats actually consume less. Factoring this in, I think the cost for a bag of Precise is very close to that of a lower quality cat food.<br /><br />I also worried the cats would not like this food, as they are extremely picky and it had reached a point that Meow Mix is all they wanted.  They love it!  I will NEVER go back to cheap grocery store cat food.\n",

It is the only brand that they consistently will eat that is grain free.  I have two cats that only eat wet food and use one 12.5 ounce can per day.  It's a great bargain compared to the smaller cans.  I would purchase it online if the cost with shipping was closer to what I pay at the local store.<br /><br />If you're trying to go GRAIN FREE or at least ALL WET FOOD for your kitties, do try Wellness.  I have tried nearly every type of grain free or lower grain or organic/natural canned cat food there is available; while my cats will eat some of the other stuff sometimes, they like Wellness the best.  I only feed them the plain Turkey and Chicken flavors, since they usually don't do too well with beef or seafood.<br /><br />(Note:  by grain free I mean no corn, wheat, or soy.  If you look at the ingredient list, there are sweet potatoes and other vegetables/fruits, so it is not just protein.)<br /><br />GO GRAIN FREE!  It's better for the kitties.<br />My 12 and 13 year old cats are shinier, healthier, and more active now that they've changed to this diet over the last year.  My fat cat lost weight and no longer has flaky skin.  They only throw up hairballs now instead of the frequent \"other\" vomits before.  And the diarrhea that was plaguing one cat for the previous two years has completely ended.  Solid, regular poops - believe me, it's a relief (yes, I know it's gross to talk about, but it's true!).<br /><br />I may take the final step to RAW DIET for them... haven't decided yet.  But at least I know on this food they are thriving.\n",

      "This review is for the 24 pack of 3 Oz. cans of the Wellness Brand Cat Food.<br /><br />Objectively speaking...<br />The cans are easy to ope and they have consistently arrived in excellent condition.  There are 24 cans at 3 oz. each.  That's all I can really say objectively about cat food.<br /><br />Subjectively speaking...<br />I could not believe the difference in my cats after switching to a canned cat food from dry food.  My cats are 15 and 16 years old.  They are healthy indoor cats who are still active and playful with no real health problems aside from my 16 year old cat having minor diabetes.  I had been feeding a high priced prescription (vet recommended) dry food for the last 2 years only to have my 15 year old cat begin getting sick and regurgitating his food on a weekly basis.  I took my cat to the vet repeatedly asking why this might be a problem.  The vet simply told me that the cat may be a little under the weather or it was hairball related...which before had not been an issue.  After a conversation with a friend in Dec 2010 they emphatically recommended canned cat food.  I decided to do some research and was I glad that I did.  My cats have been eating canned food for 2 months now and here are the changes I've noticed.  My cat who was throwing up 2-4 times a week has only done so 4 times in 2 months (and I think that was because he was biting at some straw that I didn't know about), their fur is ridiculously softer...like I just spent an hour brushing them, now it feels that way all the time.  And although my cats are not prone to hairballs, my medium haired cat would get them on occasion and he has had only 1 very small one in 2 months as opposed to the weekly ones I'd find in the house.  They have more energy and they just seem happier in how they interact and the littler box has less to be cleaned up and quite frankly it smells less offensive than it did before.  Don't get me wrong...cat boxes smell but I've been told (and now I feel I can attest to this) that dry food would dehydrate a cat and it would enter a system and absorb odors from the body and carry them out into the cat box to amplify the foul odors.  Actual cat food like the Wellness brand (not many brands are grain or rice free)  gets more fully digested by the cat and does not contain grains and rices and other fillers that are expelled with the body.  I must say that I felt the fool not having taken more time to learn about the diet possibilities of my cats.<br /><br />I will note that I also use the Wellness dry food (about 1/4 to 1/2 cup out each night) for my 2 cats to eat between their canned meals.  This is also to keep them used to eating a little dry food in case I am in a situation where I cannot provide their can in the morning and night.  For your reference I feed my cats each 1/2 a can in the morning and 1/2 in the evening (so 2 cans total daily).  I am going to switch to the 12 oz cans though because they are much cheaper, you nearly double your canned food for the same price, I'm just going to buy a resealable lid and scoop out what is needed.<br /><br />And as a side note, my cats eat most of the food when I leave it out but they do not finish it all.  I do leave the food out for them to finish up which they usually do within 1-3 hours.  Some people say you should never do this, some say they will leave it out all day...in my experience over the 2 months I have noticed no mold, illness or rejection of this food being left out for a few hours for my cats.  The longest I've seen food remain in the is at the 7 hour mark and still, it was finished with no negative behaviors or effects noticed in either of my animals.<br /><br />I hope this review helps you and please be aware specifically of what goes into certain brands.  There are cheaper canned foods but they are not as good as this brand.  I've checked and tried a few.  This one is really different.  There are a few websites which explain the health benefits more precisely and if you won't take my word for it on this brand see for yourself.  Also, the cost is well worth the response you will get from your cat and when measured against prescription dry food it really hasn't been much different and the 12 oz sizes will make it even more affordable.  Be good to yourself and your pets!\n",

      "Over the last two years, our older cat (now 11 years old) had ongoing issues with diarrhea and vomiting.  After several trips to the vet and numerous tests that found nothing wrong, we were left thinking that this was her lot in life, sensitive to hairballs with a testy stomach.  We changed her to a vet-recommended food and went on with life, but as you can imagine, she was still suffering.<br /><br />She was dehydrated, her coat was rough, she was losing muscle and constantly hungry because she was essentially living life as a non-voluntary bulimic.  At one point, I hoped a test for her thyroid would be positive so we could just figure out what on earth was wrong with her.<br /><br />Last month I decided I didn't have anything else to lose so I started researching holistic treatments for her various symptoms.  I happened upon a description of grain allergies in cats and I was astounded at the number of symptoms she had.  Her eyes were always watery, her lips and gums a little swollen, and these were things her vet and I had attributed to \"getting older\" or her \"hairball sensitivity\" since none of the test had pinpointed a problem.<br /><br />After some research to select a quality brand, I ordered Wellness Core Dry and Wet food.  I didn't bother to transition her, just started her on it right away.  Besides, she wasn't keeping down much of the other food anyway.  She took to it right away, and she's a picky one.<br />Within two days, the diarrhea was gone.  Within a week, she brought up a hairball that would shame a lesser cat.  It's been a month now and the only bad thing I can say is that I wish I'd found this food sooner.  No more watery eyes, no more swollen lips, and no more noxious fumes from the litter box.  My husband and I cannot believe that fact, but it is true.  A high-quality food WILL reduce litter box odor.  I didn't believe it until I...well...didn't smell it.<br /><br />I'm transitioning our other cat to it now and he already looks better for it.  The food has a stronger odor than store-brand cat food.  You'll also want to note that it doesn't have preservatives, so it's bound to have a stronger smell.  The wet food actually smells good, for cat food.  We use the Wellness Core 3oz Grain-Free Chicken.  I'm sure our experiences will vary, but I've watched a cat who was the epitome of finicky, who would turn her nose up at Fancy Feast if the same flavors were served back to back, gobble the same flavor everyday for the last 30 days without complaint, and most notably, without vomit.  So I'd say she gives her claw of approval.<br /><br />Bottom line?  It's pricy, sure.  But it's worth it for us.  Considering the money we're saving in paper towel clean up expenses alone, we're probably saving a buck or two.  I should also thank Amazon for making it Prime eligible, so it's easier to buy it here than to find it in the store.  So now, instead of begging me to feed them, our cats can start mauling the UPS man.\n",

      "Because of our cat's digestive problems, and due to multiple unsuccessful trials of other \"top\" brands of canned cat food, led us to try the WELLNESS brands. Our feline-centric veterinarian concurred, and I am happy to report that after 2 weeks, our cat is responding wonderfully!<br /><br />He is a \"new\" cat! He LOVES THIS FOOD!

      "I recently adopted two 8 week old kittens.  Their \"foster mother\" had been feeding them Wellness Canned for Kittens, along with <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018CE77Q\">Chicken Soup for the Kitten Lover's Soul Dry Food, Chicken Flavor, 6 Pound Bag</a>, so I decided to keep this consistent.  Also, the information the foster mother gave me on what I had thought was high quality cat food (Iams, Purina One, Science Diet) completely changed my outlook.  There is no way I would ever feed that garbage to any of my pets again.<br /><br />My kittens go crazy when I feed them the Wellness twice a day.  Their desperate meows almost sound like gasps - so cute.  I don't want them to become solely dependent on canned, so I will continue to provide them with dry food, too.  (Although, I plan to replace Chicken Soup with a higher quality, grain-free dry brand, like Orijen or Evo.)  And when the kittens are old enough, I will transition them to Wellness canned for adults.<br /><br />If you are reading this review, there's probably a good chance you already know all about cat nutrition (the issues with by-products, brewers rice, corn, some grains, etc.)  For anyone else, I would encourage you to read the nutritional information on various brands at Pet Food Ratings dot Net.  You will never look at cat food the same.<br /><br />***Update October 2012***: Since my original review, I have tried two other kinds of Wellness canned foods - sliced chicken (in the 3 oz. can) and turkey (12.5 oz. cans).  They love both.  Because the 12 oz. cans are much more economical on a per ounce basis, I am going to stick with this size.  (Tip - <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002ARWTA\">Ethical 3-1/2-Inch Pet Food Can Covers, 3-Pack</a> fit perfectly on the 12.5 oz. cans, and other reviewers have stated that they fit on the 5.5 oz can.  They are too large for the 3 oz. cans, however.)<br /><br />I continue to feed a combination of both wet and dry food.  As I mentioned above, I wanted to switch to a grain-free dry food.  I selected <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BOVE54\">Wellness Grain-Free Dry Cat Food for Adult Cats & Kittens, CORE Original Fish & Fowl Recipe, 12 lb. Bag</a>, and my cats love it.\n",

However, I have never fed either of them especially junky foods so they may just not know what they are missing.\n",

      "Our cat, Isabel, has struggled with UTI and weight issues for years. After our vet recommended a wet food only diet, we experimented with a variety of brands (included Rx), but could never find a wet food that made Isabel feel full, and not spend the rest of the day begging us for more food.<br /><br />Then we tried Wellness canned food.<br /><br />Isabel loves it (but she loves anything that resembles food, so that's not a huge hurdle), but what is great about Wellness is it fills her up! And not only has she stopped constantly begging for food, she started to lose weight! Her dandruff is going away, she is no longer lethargic and has started to play again, and she generally seems like a happier cat.<br /><br />Now that her chronic UTI has finally cleared up, we give her mostly Wellness canned food with a little bit of dry food mixed in. This is still her primary source of food, and she is just as happy now as when we first made the switch.\n",

      "I have a seven year old gray tabby named Buddy.  I got him when he was three.  He is a very large cat, as the vet has a target weight for him at 18 pounds.  Unfortunately, he has been over 20 pounds since I got him.  While he is not fat, he is definitely in need of shedding a couple of pounds.<br /><br />I had always fed him dry cat food.  He was regularly eating Hill's Science Diet when I got him, and I was reluctant to change.  I thought that some of his minor health problems were just a part of having a cat around.  He tended to cough up massive hairballs, he would vomit stomach bile if he wasn't fed for more than a few hours, and his shedding was ridiculously constant.<br /><br />About six months ago, my vet recommended that I switch to canned food in an effor to keep his weight under control.  I quickly went out and bought a bunch of Hills Science Diet canned food, and he didn't like it very much. So I started to do a bit of research on what was the best food available for cats, and I was amazed at what I found.<br /><br />My research led me to Wellness, and I haven't looked back.  My cat has been eating mostly Wellness now for about three months.  No more hairballs.  No more stomach bile.  His shedding has been reduced drastically.  I have also noticed that his litter box doesn't smell nearly as bad, which I assume is the result of him not being chornically dehydrated from the dry food.  I've also noticed that he doesn't strain as hard to pass stool, which I'm sure he'd appreciate if he understood why.  But the most obvious change is my lethargic and overweight cat now jumps and runs around the house like he's lost three years in age, and he has indeed lost three pounds.  He was at the vet's target weight within a month of starting to eat Wellness, and he has maintained that weight for the past two months.<br /><br />The most important question, though, is how does he feel about it?  He loves it.  When I was feeding him Hill's, I would have to clean his bowl every time I fed him because he would leave pieces stuck to the side that would dry out like oatmeal.  With Wellness, he licks his bowl completely clean purring very loudly while he does it.  His favorite flavor is the chicken and salmon, but I can't stand the smell of the seafood.  So he gets his second favorite, chicken and beef.  He's not a big fan of the poultry only flavors, but he still likes them better than the Hill's he used to have to eat.<br /><br />A few days ago, I actually ran out of Wellness, and I fed him a can of Hill's to get by for the night until I could go buy more.  At 5:00 AM, I would up to the sound of my cat puking up stomach bile.<br /><br />From now on, it's Wellness or nothing.\n",

      "I purchased this cat food after reading glowing recommendations from two or three different cat nutrition websites. One site did offer the caveat that while the quality of this brand was excellent it would not help the cat's diet if he refused to eat it and the reviewer's experience was that some cats would love it and others wouldn't touch it. My cat was somewhere in the middle - he didn't love it, but he would sometimes leave it half-eaten and the rest would dry up.<br /><br />My 8 year old cat is new to canned food - he has been fed a diet of 99.5 percent dry food since we adopted him as a half-grown kitten. (The other .5 percent he obtained himself from ferns and the occasional mouse. After reading an article about the nutritional needs of cats, I discovered that our rotund feline was getting too many carbohydrates and not enough protein, and I began adding canned cat food along side his daily bowl of dry food. I have tried a few different brands to find something that suits him.<br /><br />The Wellness canned cat food (I purchased the chicken and herring formula)has a pate-texture and I think this was my pet's primary objection to it. After trying several different canned foods, I find that he prefers more of a filet in gravy style preparation.<br /><br />When I first gave this to my cat I simply plopped the chunk of food into his bowl - leaving it largely in a solid can-shaped blob. Later, I began to add a half-can of warm water to the bowl and mix it up to make a thinner mush. Using this method, he seems to do fine with it, so I may or may not purchase it again.\n",

It didn't take long for us to settle on Wellness because of its premium ingredients and stellar reputation.<br /><br />Thankfully, our cats LOVE this food. They're happy, and we're happy because it's so good for them! We gladly spend the extra money to ensure the health and well being of our two furry children. They love the turkey, chicken, and turkey/salmon varieties, which are all grain free.

      "There is a feline diabetes epidemic out there.  My cat was self-feeding dry food (Purina Urinary Tract Health) which has a huge proportion of cereal carbs.  When she developed diabetes the vet advised adding Science Prescription Diet DM wet canned foot to augment the dry.  She needed less and less insulin and finally we were told she didn't need it at all. Still letting her self-feed the Purina dry foot while feeding her the wet canned, she had a relapse.  I decided to toss the Purina and just feed her the wet food and she's been fine for almost a year now.  I'm hoping she'll remain diabetes-free for the rest of her life.<br /><br />The Wellness food, labeled \"Core,\" is very low carb and both my cats love it!  It contains a lot of water (\"no more than 78%\" is what the label says -- kinda expensive way to keep your cats in water ;)<br /><br />I justify the expense by accepting that my cat would be needing $100 vials of insulin, plus frequent vet checks of her blood. Instead I'm spending the money on food.<br /><br />As a side note, our other cat without diabetes loves this food, too.  She had urologic problems, was always licking herself, and used to smell really, really bad. She's doing super now and I attribute it to the wet, cereal-free food.<br /><br />I highly recommend working with your vet to wean your cat off dry cereal foods, especially if they're diabetic.  The Wellness canned food is fantastic and might save your kitty's life!\n",

They all accepted the food with no issues.<br /><br />I was a little worried at first as to how much they ate as it could be expensive, but within a few days they leveled themselves out. I am just thrilled with the food and their reactions. I will promote this food to all my new homes. The food smells good enough to eat.

      "My 14 year-old cat was diagnosed with Diabetes and Chronic Renal Failure earlier this year; it was devastating. I had to administer insulin shots to him twice a day and twice he had hypo-glycemia due to the enormous challenge of balancing insulin levels. Worse, he was miserable and wary of me.<br /><br />At 16 lbs, he was overweight even for a large frame cat so I promptly began an intensive internet research (agree with the earlier poster who cautions against the foods prescribed by vets and sold in grocery stores) and after narrowing the field of high-protein pet foods, decided to try wet food. I was nervous because I had been guilty of feeding my baby delicious, awful-for-him dry foods (I was clueless) so I had no idea how long the transition to Wellness wet would take.<br /><br />There was no transition: He loved the food immediately and the switch was painless. Best, he lost 4 lbs in about 6 months, his blood sugar has stabilized and he's off insulin, hopefully permanently.<br /><br />Wellness isn't cheap, but when compared with the cost of losing a beloved furry member of the family too soon, the price is well-justified!<br /><br />ps.

      "When my female cat came down w/pancreatitis a few years ago (to the tune of $1000), I started researching what her diet should include.  My vet wanted her on canned food that was low in carbs, but Gracie didn't care for it the prescription brand I was buying at the vet.  Also, I noticed on the can that corn was an ingredient.  I asked her about this, considering corn is a sugary veggie and she also wanted Gracie to lose about 3-4 lbs.  She told me that the main idea was to have her eat a canned food that was 8% or less in carbohydrates IN A DRY STATE.  That means, they take the food, dry it out and get the true percentages of carbs, etc.<br />When I did some research on the web about pancreatitus in cats, I found that GRAIN in cat food can bring on and/or aggravate the condition. I read many articles that explained that cats DON'T NEED grain in their diet.  Pet food manufacturers put it in there because it sounds good to us, the pet owners, when we read that the food contains brown rice, etc.  But what's good for us, as we all know, isn't always good for them.<br /><br />I looked at many companies that made Grain-Free food and was very impressed w/Wellness.  They have many varieties that are grain-free.  When I called them to get the percentage of carbs in a dry matter basis, they were prepared and quick to answer w/out having to transfer me 10 times.<br />The food is not inexpensive, but my cat REALLY likes it.  This bout w/pancreatitis occured about 4 years ago. She has been on Wellness ever since and is in excellent health. She is now 14 yrs old.<br /><br />I highly endorse this product.

      "The pet food industry can be one of the most infuriating as you start doing research and discovering what trash manufacturers (and the vets who get paid off by the manufacturers) push onto the unsuspecting public. For reference, don't ask your vet - do some Internet research at sites like, for example, petfoodratings.net. What you'll find is that even the supposed \"high-end\" lines from basically every major supermarket label are horrible for your fuzzy friends. People who trust the marketing or trust their vets overpay and feed their cats foods that are full of carcinogens, cheap ingredients that are inappropriate for a cat's digestive system, and byproducts that provide nothing of value and are basically a way to make cheap profit off of literal garbage. It's a tragedy, as these same cats end up with shorter lifespans, kidney problems, UTIs, cancer, and a host of other issues, all of which could have been avoided by a high quality food.<br /><br />This is an A-Grade food. What you'll find here is very high protein content, many meat meals, good carbs and oils, and no grains, which is great as a cat is not an omnivore, it's a carnivore, and it simply does not need grains. It has 50 percent protein, which is among the highest you'll see in cat food. The first 4 ingredients are all meats.<br /><br />What you will NOT find here is the kind of junk you'll see in things like Purina One and Science Diet - byproducts (aka beaks, feathers, bird feet), brewers rice (aka the waste product from making beer), wheat flour (a leading cause of pet allergies), corn gluten (a cheap waste of space), and things like \"liver flavor\" (because they don't want to pay for the real thing). I didn't just pull those ingredients out of the air - I was reading the ingredients list of Purina One. It's pathetic.<br /><br />Don't feed your cats trash. Pay a little more to feed them good food now, and they'll lead longer, healthier, more satisfied lives as a result. It's worth it.\n",

Although my kittens readily took to the Fancy Feast brand, it is not the most healthy of foods - my biggest concern being the by-product content.

And the best part is that it is a very healthy food - no grains, no by-products.  There is a little gravy in the bottom of the can so I put a little bit of water in, give it a swirl, put it on top of the food - and whalah - instant broth and MORE water for my babies to lap up which is so vital for avoiding UTI's.<br /><br />I just can't say enough - good - about this product.

I supplement with one serving from <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012PZ7U0\">Holistic Select Feline Radiant Adult and Kitten Health Chicken Meal Recipe Dry Cat Food, 3-Pound Bag</a>.<br /><br />The cats ages range currently from 7 to 17.  The below feeding schedule is modified slightly (sometimes only two feedings a day, maybe half the amount of dry, etc.)  If your cat has a sensitive tummy, it is best to feed more frequent, smaller meals each day.<br /><br />The 7 and 13 yo boys get about 1/4 cup dry per day.<br />The 17 yo girl gets about 1/8 cup dry per day.<br /><br />I then split one can between all three twice a day.  When the can is first opened, I add little hot water to the wet food.  This guarantees a consistent texture between different batches,  The remainder of the can is covered with a plastic lid, and placed in the refrigerator.  I then later pull out (don't leave in fridge for more than 2 days), separate into three servings, and mix at least 1/8 cup hot water.  Then, nuke for 5 to 7 seconds (to warm up), and walla, a gravy mix meal for kitties.<br /><br />I can verify 100% that their health improved greatly after switching from the cheap, grocery store dry.  Its the only reason Baby Girl is still alive.  If you can't afford heavy vet bills, put your pets on this and some money into savings, in lieu of the overpriced pet insurance.<br /><br />With the free shipping, it is still a deal.<br /><br />Edit: I've added to the review after it appeared Product Not Available.  If you hit create review, THEN hit Edit review, apparently it takes.\n",

      "I have a 1 1/2 year old cat and started feeding him canned food after reading about how cats don't naturally have a strong thirst drive and need most of their water to come from their food like in nature. Also as another reviewer said, this food doesn't have any of the crappy by-products that \"Science Diet\" and other highly marketed brands have. These brands even have by-products in their canned food.<br /><br />Cats are carnivores so the majority of their diet needs to be meat (aside from the small amount of veggies you might find in a mouse's or rabbit's stomach in the wild).<br /><br />Aside from that, my cat LOVES this food and it is very good for him. He eats a variety of flavors so he doesn't get sick of one.\n",

      "I recently did a bunch of research on Cat nutrition, and my conclusion was that the Wellness cat foods offered the best combination of excellent nutrition, good variety, and affordability.  So I bought some for my crotchety, picky, 16+ year old cat who had been eating Nutro.  To my great relief, she accepted the switch without complaint!<br /><br />Although I haven't had a long history with this cat food yet, I've been pleased with the results so far, and based on my research I'm convinced I'm doing right by my furry friend.  I certainly recommend it.\n",

      "I am a huge fan of Wellness, as well as a few other holistic brands of animal food. I am new to this product, as we have just been adopted by a brother and sister pair. This is even better than the adult formula we were giving them in the mean time, because this satiates them by giving them more of what they need, so I actually have to feed them less.<br /><br />To those poo-pooing the fruits, veggies, seeds etc., the protein and fat content are the highest you can find outside of making it yourself, and you would still find yourself having to add these items. Even though cats are true carnivores and most wouldn't eat these other things by themselves in the wild, the fact is is that they DO eat non-meat items, when they eat their prey. They don't just eat muscle, they also eat the contents of the intestines, stomach, crops, and gizzards, and many try to get in the skull for the fats and lipids (because most wild prey will be very lean this is often the only place to get them). The trick is getting everything in the right proportions, and using actual, nutritious food.<br /><br />The price, yes, it is more. But, my family has had many, many, animals over the last 25 years, and we have seen the difference that a GOOD diet makes. And in the long run, it can help save an awful lot in vet bills.\n",

      "I recently took home two bengal kittens, and wanted to do everything \"right\", learning from past mistakes, and one of the mistakes I had made in the past was not researching cat nutrition enough.  So this time I did.  There are quite a few top quality foods out there that aren't full of grain and \"meat-meal\", but I chose wellness because it is a bit more affordable, and is popular enough to be available at local pet stores as well as online.<br /><br />Now the big hurdle...do the kittens accept it?  Well, mine sure did.  I was a bit worried because they had been eating mostly Royal Canin dry food at the breeders house, but they took to it immediately and now are very passionate about dinner time.  Excellent!  I couldn't be happier.  Expensive?  Yes, unfortunately it is, but it is actually cheaper than Royal Canin and several of the others and in the case of Royal Canin, it has *much* better ingredients!  Do the research yourself and see, don't take my word for it!\n",

      "My 14 year old feline - Archie - was diagnosed with diabetes 2 weeks ago.  His diet for the previous 6 years consisted solely of Science Diet (adult/senior/light/age defying)kibble and a small amount of Friskie's canned at dinner time.  Per his veterinarians instructions to feed only high quality canned (wet) foods, I purchased Science Diet MD for diabetic cats.  Over the course of the following 3 days, there was no significant change in Archie's blood glucose which prompted me to start investigating cat foods a little more thoroughly.<br /><br />As stated on the Science Diet MD label, their carbohydrate content tested at 13%.  This seemed very high to me as diabetes maintenance is nearly ALL about carbohydrates.<br /><br />I discovered that Wellness brand Chicken tested at 4% carbohydrates. The fat content, at 60%, is higher than I'd like, but I'm okay with that, at least for the time being.  Archie's blood glucose plummeted 100 points within 24 hours of his first meal of Wellness Chicken.<br /><br />At less than $3.00 per 12.5 oz. (Amazon price PLUS free shipping)compared to Science Diet MD at $2.75 per 5.5 oz., Wellness also wins in the cost category. A double win X2 as I live in Alaska which is prone to unnecessary and outrageous shipping fees from unscrupulous/lazy vendors.<br /><br />Wellness Chicken is not vegetable free - it does contain peas and potato fillers (among others) but it is grain free which is also in it's favor.  Cats, after all, are carnivores.  It makes sense to me that their diet reflect this as much as possible/affordable.<br /><br />Highly recommended!\n",

Fortunately they can't, so I'm giving it a 3 stars for effort :)  I realize that different cats used to different foods, however mine for some reason would rather starve than eat turkey formula cat food from Wellness. Otherwise I trust Wellness brand, they seem to put good ingredients, and no grains.<br />Also there was no mentioning anywhere about quantity.

First ingredient is plain turkey.<br /><br />Wellness Cubed 3oz varieties are my cat's favorites.  Sliced type is second, minced is third.  I also feed Wellness pouches and pate styles, plus Core as well.<br /><br />Cube size is approximately 1/3rd of an inch.<br /><br />Turkey is what I prefer to feed them, Salmon and Tuna are their favorite, but I try to feed less fish, make sure they get plenty of high protein turkey instead.<br /><br />Analysis:<br />Crude Protein  Not Less Than  8.0%<br />Crude Fat  Not Less Than  4.0%<br />Crude Fiber  Not More Than  1.0%<br />Moisture  Not More Than  82.0%<br />Ash  Not More Than  2.8%<br />Magnesium  Not More Than  0.025%<br />Taurine  Not Less Than  0.05%<br /><br />Ingredients: Turkey, Turkey Broth, Water Sufficient for Processing, Peas, Dried Egg Whites, Natural Flavor, Dried Egg Product, Guar Gum, Spinach, Sodium Phosphate, Ground Flaxseed, Salt, Potassium Chloride, Cranberries, Minerals (Iron Amino Acid Chelate, Zinc Amino Acid Chelate, Cobalt Amino Acid Chelate, Copper Amino Acid Chelate, Manganese Amino Acid Chelate, Sodium Selenite, Potassium Iodide), Carrageenan, Taurine, Vitamins (Vitamin E Supplement, Thiamine Mononitrate, Niacin, Vitamin B-12 Supplement, d-Calcium Pantothenate, Pyridoxine Hydrochloride, Vitamin D-3 Supplement, Riboflavin Supplement, Vitamin A Supplement, Biotin, Folic Acid), Choline Chloride.\n",

      "Our kittens will eat anything, even styrofoam & rubber bands if they can find it. but our older cats are very picky & spoiled. It used to be that we could only get them to eat Fancy Feast, then after they tried Fancy Feast Medlies, they wouldn't eat the regular Fancy Feast anymore. Now the only thing they'll eat is Natural Balance & Wellness, which are even more expencive, though they're not at all picky about cereal or treats. So we're spending about $80 a month on wet cat food, $100 if you include cereal & litter, & this is with a Petco discount.<br /><br />I'm not really pleased with the inclusion of vegetables though; our vet told us that cats cannot digest plant matter & that it only serves to make them poop more. Alos either Natural Balance or Wellness is giving our kittens random boughts of diarrhea.\n",

      "About the only thing wrong I can find with Wellness canned is the number of people who complain that their cats won't eat it -- even cats that were eating Wellness for awhile, suddenly they seem to lose interest.  People scramble to find why their cat suddenly won't eat it (\"they've been eating Wellness for years!\"), and end up blaming it on the company.<br /><br />It's not necessarily the company's fault. It's at least partially your fault for creating a routine in which you allowed your cat to become so finicky.<br /><br />As a human, there are a few brands I prefer simply because I grew up with them, and I know the taste of those brands blind-folded. I'm finicky about them.  Cats are *super*-sensitive and can taste even the smallest changes - including the plant their can of food was processed from!!!<br /><br />Don't let your cat become so finicky by feeding only one brand or flavor or variety consistently for years.  Mix it up.  Wellness may be the best, but there are several high-quality brands of canned cat food on the market in the U.S. today -- look into them.<br /><br />I highly recommend rotating a few brands of high-quality canned foods if you have any problems with feeding Wellness to your cat, and even if you're not. Wellness is still a great brand of food (the best in my opinion), still containing the same high-quality ingredients as it ever did.  My cat loves it and I feed several flavors (Chicken, Beef & Chicken, Turkey) as part of his rotation.\n",

      "Until I am able to make my own raw diet for my cat, I purchase this food for her, and I've been able to tell a noticeable difference in her health and energy levels. I used to feed her Purina One dry food, but after a ton of research and questions, I'm slowly figuring out what she really needs to thrive. Wellness uses human-grade ingredients, and while I don't care for the Guar Gum or Carageenan additives, it's still a product worth buying.<br /><br />With regards to the one star rating, shame on you for buying from a breeder, and for passing up \"health food\" for your pets. Just because they can survive on cheap food that doesn't use natural ingredients, doesn't mean it's good for them. Children can survive on a diet of sugar cereal and cheeseburgers, but no responsible parent would feed that to them, either. If you love your kids, you make them eat their vegetables.<br /><br />In conclusion, it may take a little while for your kitty to accept natural food that isn't filled with nasty additives and flavorings to make it stinky, but when they do you will see an improvement! I also recommend Natural Balance canned food, another good quality diet. Raw food is best, but high quality canned food is still head and shoulders above dry kibble diets.\n",

I only wish the Wellness came in larger cans and offered more varieties just for kittens.<br /><br />I sure hope it's as good as claimed...I want to give my beautiful kitten the best possible diet but it is hard to know what is really lurking in those cans.<br /><br />That is why I only buy what is considered high-quality, premium foods for him. He eats a mixture of canned and frozen raw from Nature's Variety.<br /><br />(The raw medallions are his favorite of everything I feed him! )  I will continue to feed him Wellness canned food as he matures.\n",

I trust my vet and will continue to feed this food. My local Food Co-Op carries this food and it is cheaper than the vet's price.  My cat's health is important to me.<br />I switch between the chicken and the salmon varieties.

To make matters worse, one of our cats has suddenly developed a swollen lower lip. This can be due to an allergic reaction, and it makes us wonder if it's a response to the obviously different product we received and fed to them.<br /><br />Update 5-27-10:  As noted above, the first two cases were different than what's in the stores.

      "The pet food industry can be one of the most infuriating as you start doing research and discovering what trash manufacturers (and the vets who get paid off by the manufacturers) push onto the unsuspecting public.  For reference, don't ask your vet - do some Internet research at sites like, for example, petfoodratings.net.  What you'll find is that even the supposed \"high-end\" lines from basically every major supermarket label are horrible for your fuzzy friends.  People who trust the marketing or trust their vets overpay and feed their cats foods that are full of carcinogens, cheap ingredients that are inappropriate for a cat's digestive system, and byproducts that provide nothing of value and are basically a way to make cheap profit off of literal garbage.  It's a tragedy, as these same cats end up with shorter lifespans, kidney problems, UTIs, cancer, and a host of other issues, all of which could have been avoided by a high quality food.<br /><br />This is an A-Grade food.  What you'll find here is very high protein content, many meat meals, potatoes, salmon oil, flax seed, and no grains, which is great as a cat is not an omnivore, it's a carnivore, and it simply does not need grains.  It has 50 percent protein, which is among the highest you'll see in cat food.  The first 4 ingredients are all meats.<br /><br />What you will NOT find here is the kind of junk you'll see in things like Purina One and Science Diet - byproducts (aka beaks, feathers, bird feet), brewers rice (aka the waste product from making beer), wheat flour (a leading cause of pet allergies), corn gluten (a cheap waste of space), and things like \"liver flavor\" (because they don't want to pay for the real thing).  I didn't just pull those ingredients out of the air - I was reading the ingredients list of Purina One.  It's pathetic.<br /><br />Don't feed your cats trash.

It was overkill, but the canned goods arrived without a dent every single time.<br /><br />Now, on my third shipment in a row, at least one can is dented, and we are talking massively dented to the point where on this 12oz can if you put another on top it won't stand straight because the top is now at an angle.  The problem is they use these tiny boxes barely large enough to contain the cat food cans, and the bubble wrap is just these extra large bubbles only placed on two of the four sides, leaving two sides exposed to UPS who inevitably dents most of the cans on those sides.<br /><br />I don't consider this UPS's fault, as they handle so many packages they can't afford to treat them like raw eggs, its Amazon's fault for repeat inadequate shipping.

It resolved a diarrhea problem quickly-- we think one of the cats became allergic to something in that Fancy Feast.  They enjoy Wellness much more; they have never attacked any food or treat more voraciously, even real chicken.  Plus, the litter box does not smell as bad, and I feel better about giving them food without nasty byproducts.  This is described as human-quality food, though I haven't been brave enough to try, I believe it.  Instead of smelling like a bag of fast food that got stuck under the seat in my car for a month, this smells like chicken soup.<br /><br />We tried getting our boys onto Avoderm, which definitely made their coats shinier and softer, and even increased their activity level (hard to believe for these Bengals).  However, once the mix got to be over 50% Avoderm, they didn't like the taste.  Can't give a low rating to any cat food because of taste.<br /><br />One note about shipping-- the packaging has not been perfect, but it's not nearly as bad as some of the other reviewers say.  The second case I received had a few cans with minor dents, but nothing was leaking.

Also, with it being moist food I can easily add a joint supplement to our older cat's food.  The only downside, like most moist food, is that the cats started having hairballs again.  This is why we give them this for only half of their meals and use dry food for the other half.  I switched their dry food also, but to a brand that isn't sold here, so I won't mention the brand.<br /><br />We love that this doesn't smell bad or give our cats digestive problems.  Cheaper moist cat food smells horrible and upsets our cats' digestive systems (which also smells horrible ;)).  I like that this is made with \"human grade\" ingredients.

It wasn't until the past couple of years or so that I became aware of the hazards of clay litter (causes respiratory problems in cats, dangerous for young kittens who haven't mastered the art of pottying [they step in their pee, litter clumps to the paws, kitten licks off litter and injests it, kitten dies]). But the healthier stuff is so expensive, and I believed that the stuff we were using was safe enough (we were buying relatively low-dust clay litter). Then we found another kitty on the streets and my brother had a baby, and we became aware of the smells of the litterboxes. There was a definite smell that we hadn't noticed before. So we started trying different stuff, like the 99% dust-free clay, which I still believe is the best of the clay litters. But the smell still remained, no matter how many fans you turned on or how often you used fragrance sprays. I pondered trying Feline Pine (great price at Walmart) or crystals but worried about how my cats would take to weird-looking \"kibbles.\"<br /><br />So a few days ago we took the plunge and bought a bag of Swheat Scoop, which I'd been wanting to try for the past year, and the first thing I noticed when I poured it into a clean box (I didn't bother slowly converting it, the clay litter went into the garbage) was that there was no dust. And just 10 minutes later, the room was obviously much more, well, smell-free. As an experiment, we're using only one box with Swheat Scoop, in my bedroom, and the other two litterboxes downstairs still have clay litter. It's a great way to find out if a cat doesn't like the new stuff without the cat pooping on the floor in a corner because she feels there's no other choice. Plus, being in a small room, it'd be easier to smell anything. So far, the results are obvious. The downstairs stinks, but the upstairs, even the bedroom in particular, is smell-free. Fortunately for me, my bedroom is right across from the bathroom, so I don't have to worry about treking across the house several times a day to clean the box. This is my favorite part, that I can flush it. My back is in heaven! My knees are thanking me! My skin has stopped crawling! All I have to do is bend over, scoop up the poop or pee clump and go to the bathroom and chuck the waste into the toilet. If needed, I return to the box and repeat the process. It's definitely much better than kneeling down and trying to breathe while scooping dusty poop and pee into a bag, then hauling the thing outside (I don't think it was ever an option having exposed poop and pee lying in a garbage can inside the house, lol). I don't know yet if there is a difference when it comes to completely cleaning it out, that is, by dumping out the litter iself and starting over fresh. It must be, because now I don't have to fret about where to put the litter (can't distribute it in the alley driveway, since when it rains, a mess ensues, and if I put it in a bag and put it in the garbage by the back door, you get attacked by the offending smell when you leave or enter the house). Maybe I can dump the Swheat Scoop into the garden at the front of the house, but it'll be at least a few weeks before I have to decide, so we'll see what happens.<br /><br />As for clumping, it works great. It takes a little bit longer for the clumping to actually clump than clay does. When Molly (the newest cat in the family) tried out the litter during the first day we had it, she peed and then tried burying it, but she's a vigorous digger, so she started digging THROUGH the pee, which hadn't clumped yet. So I had to stop her and wait for teeny tiny clumps to form so I could get as much pee out as I could. But if the cat avoids distributing the pee throughout the whole box because she's paranoid about not burying it, everything is fine. Just wait 5 minutes (or less! I haven't exactly timed it yet, lol) and it'll be clumped well enough to move it to the toilet. So far as I can tell, Molly uses it the most, but I don't think Willow has tried it yet (she has sensitive toesies, so I really think she'll like it once she tries it) and I think Buffy has used it only once. SOMEBODY besides Molly has used it at least once already, because the poop I found in there yesterday wasn't the mushy poop that comes from Molly's sensitive tummy. And it's possible that Willow has peed in there by now because I found a Willow-sized clump of pee last night.<br /><br />All in all, I've VERY satisfied with Swheat Scoop and I think it'll be worth the jump in price to keep using it.\n",

      "I have been trying various cat litters that are made from things other than clay, so that my cats have less impact on the environment and so that I can flush everything down the toilet.  I tried World's best cat litter, which is basically just toasted cracked corn, and it worked quite well, even in my automatic litter box.  However, it's expensive - about [...] a pound.  You end up spending close to [...] a month for litter for two cats.<p>So when I saw Swheat Scoop for about half the price I thought I'd try it.  It was similar to World's Best in that it's made from wheat so it's flushable and natural.  Only problem is it works horribly in the automatic box, although they claim it can be used there.  The cat's liquid waste turns the litter into a pasty, sticky gob that sticks to the litter box bottom and/or to the rakes when they come by to clean the box.  It simply isn't worth the price savings if you want a natural cat litter, at least if you have an automatic box.  I guess it would be passable if you have a conventional litter box.\n",

      "I have 6 cats and I love this product.  I don't have to worry about the clay getting digested by my cats or my family for that matter.  One of my cats was getting sick from the clay, so I tried this since it was natural.  Voila, healthy kitties!!<br /><br />Sure it may not work in new fangled litter boxes but I don't think it was made to do that.  It's a scoop litter that must sit for probably more than 10 min. to stay in a ball.<br /><br />I love it and that's all that counts to me!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Plus this price is awesome.  I usually have to travel 2 and a half hours to get this so the shipping is worth my gas and travel time!!  Thank you!!!\n",

      "I switched the litterboxes in my home to Swheat Scoop with the rabbit's safety in mind, but it has also done very well in controlling cat odors. I generally use a liner, but I've not had much trouble getting solid bits at the bottom out when I don't. Then again, the main box is round, so there are no corners for dirty litter to stick to, and the plastic of the box is a slippery-type, so that could play a part in it.<br /><br />Those with concerns about dust in the litter should go with smaller sizes rather than the 40-lb. bags: because of they way they're packed and stacked, some in-bag grinding of the grain is inevitable.\n",

      "I tried Swheat Scoop after our adopted stray produced four unexpected little kittens. Figuring it would be a safe training litter, we bought a big bag of it.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />- It has generally the same consistency as regular litter, making the transfer from \"kitten box\" to \"big kitty box\" much easier.<br /><br />- There seemed to be much less dust than with clay litter.<br /><br />- Flushable<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />- Takes awhile to dissolve in the toilet before you can flush<br /><br />- Clumps are gummy for a long time until they harden, which after, is like cement.<br /><br />- As mentioned by another user, there is a \"fermenting dough\" smell. I cleaned out the box every day, but with four kittens and a full grown cat, the smell was unavoidable. That, and it's just a really strange smell that makes people go \"What IS that?\" when they catch a whiff of it. Rather embarassing.<br /><br />- Pantry beetles! If you have larder or pantry beetles in your area and they overwinter indoors, watch out.<br /><br />In my case, they were just drawn to the box, and to the bag that held the clean litter. I'd find the beetles in every stage of growth, especially the larvae. It can be very hard to get rid of them, even if you keep your house meticulously neat, as they burrow down into the carpet where you can't see them. After doing a bit of research (I didn't know what they were and called them \"dirtybugs\") I found out that they like to get into grains. (Which explains why I found some once at my boyfriend's old apartment in a box of Wheat-Thins) So, clean the area, clean it often, and kep any extra littler in a covered bin.<br /><br />I give the product 3 stars because it's a natural litter that's not too different from regular litter, but it loses points for the \"fermenting dough\" smell and the bugs.\n",

      "After trying and being disappointed with two other \"natural\" cat litters (Feline Pine and Worlds's Best) I tried Swheat Scoop. I was pleased from the very first day. It clumps far more tightly than World's Best so it makes scooping the clumps much less messy and leaves less stinky litter behind in the cat box. I made the mistake of not filling the box to 3\" and I did have a slight odor problem for awhile, but since I realized I needed more litter, I have had NO problems at all. And with the previous litters, there were some days that I'd come home and the whole house smelled of cat box (I have a small house.) I have not had this problem AT ALL with Swheat Scoop.<br /><br />Pluses:  Natural, clumps tightly, very little dust, flushable, quite effective job of absorbing odors<br /><br />Minus:  For best flushable results you need to let the clumps soak in the toilet for 20 minutes before flushing. Not really a big deal, but I'd rather be able to flush right away.\n",

      "Reading the other reviews of this product is fascinating.  Bugs?  Dust?  Gooey messes?  Allergic reactions? My experience with Swheat Scoop has been, happily, quite different.  Heretofore, I've used clumping clay-based litters, most recently Arm & Hammer brand.  With all of them, though, I've observed that they are very dusty when being poured into the litter box, that they cake onto the cats' feet and are tracked through the house, and that they do little to mask the odor of urine or feces.  By contrast, Swheat Scoop has none of these drawbacks.<br /><br />After using a 15-pound box for the first time with two cats, I have observed that:<br /><br />- There is minimal tracking out of the litter box, and what there is is easily swept up, unlike clay litter which, when wet, sticks to the tile floor.<br /><br />- There is only a pleasant, natural odor which completely absorbs all urine and feces odors, making the litter box room much more pleasant.<br /><br />- There is no evidence of any dust whatsoever, even when pouring from the container into the litter box.<br /><br />- Clumping is satisfactory.  Sheat Scoop does not clump as tightly as clumping clay litters but is still easily scooped out of the litter box with a scoop designed for that purpose.  It does not adhere to the sides or the bottom of the litter box as clay litter does, and the box has stayed much, much cleaner than when it was filled with clay litter.  I realize that this directly contradicts some other reviewers' comments, but it is what I have observed.<br /><br />- Again in contradiction to several other reviewers' observations, no weevils or any other insect life form infested the box of Swheat Scoop.  It was perfectly lifeless!<br /><br />- Although the instructions advise acclimating cats to the new litter by putting a layer of the old litter to which they are accustomed on top, I switched the litter completely and suddenly, and both cats took to the Swheat Scoop immediately.  They had no adjustment problems whatsoever.<br /><br />- The instructions also advise that some household pets may look upon the wheat content as food and try to consume the litter.  However, my omnivorous canine, who would eat himself into oblivion if opportunity permitted, has never once attempted to nibble on the litter.<br /><br />In short, this is the cleanest, best-smelling, and most effective cat litter I have ever come across, and both cats took to it immediately.  I am thoroughly pleased with its appearance, odor, cleanliness, and performance. (And I can't believe that I'm actually writing a review of kitty litter, but this product is worth it!)  I'm not discounting the negative experiences which some other reviewers have reported, but I cannot explain them unless there are environmental conditions at work.  My first box of Swheat Scoop was purchased and used in semi-arid states low in humidity and with pretty low winter temperatures.  Were I in a wetter, warmer southern state, perhaps my experience and satisfaction with Swheat Scoop would have been different.\n",

      "Without SWheat I would have had to give up my companions.  My cats help me keep my sense of humor, make me laugh, and purr in bed.<br /><br />I am profoundly sensitive to chemicals.  All other kitty litters have chemicals in them.  You might not be able to smell them as they use another chemcial to cover up the smell.  My body can sense these chemicials.<br /><br />My cats adjusted quite well to SWheat but they do complain because I don't use as much at a time as I used to.  That has been their only complaint.<br /><br />Since I am unable to leave my apartment due to the toxic air it has been a blessing to have Amazon.com.  I can have my SWheat delivered to my basement apartment which means someone else carries that 40 pounds down 16 steps.\n",

      "I have 2 spayed, female cats. Neither are vigorous diggers, there are two large litter pans side by side. Neither cat is fussy about litter type.<br /><br />Pluses:<br />-- flushable (my top reason for use, I don't have trash service)<br />-- acceptable clumping (but I have never used the clay litters to compare)<br />-- non toxic & no lung choking perfumes (I am bothered by potent odors)<br /><br />Minuses:<br />-- cost<br />-- to eliminate odor you must add an additional product<br />-- for best results you have to clean box daily<br />-- cost (it's a byproduct of wheat production that is likely swept up off a factory floor somewhere, wrapped in a fancy brand name and sold at TOP DOLLAR)<br /><br />Notes & Suggestions:<br /><br />-- I have found that the urine sinks to the bottom and sticks there. If I tip the box so the dry litter is out of the way, then I can scoop out just the clumped litter and any granules that break off. This helps to reduce odor.<br />-- Every time after I scoop the box, I sprinkle baking soda over the top. I find that it sticks to the pee soaked clumps, so it must be replenished.<br />-- I don't put new litter in every time... instead I let the level get lower and lower. Then at the end of the week, I completely dispose of everything in the box, wash the box with diluted bleach and soap, refill with fresh litter.<br />-- Without baking soda, this stuff does small like warm bread that's been peed on... I can't imagine what the corn based stuff must smell like?! I have smelled corn based products (cat food, corn gluten fertilizer, chicken food & chicken poop which smells identical BTW, etc..) and they are revolting to me. Personal preference.<br />-- I pour my bags right into a galvanized, sealed can. I have not had any problems with insects. Although I can imagine that it would easily be an issue if it is not kept in a sealed container.<br />-- I did find evidence of a mouse getting into the litter box. I dealt with him, and do not have any mouse issues in my house. If you already battle with these creatures, it could be a concern.<br />-- If I leave the box more than two days without cleaning, I do experience the gooey state of clumping. This litter was a COMPLETE bust at my sister's house. She has 4 cats, 2 boxes and doesn't like to clean on a daily basis.<br /><br />POSSIBLE CHEAPER ALTERNATIVE:<br />--Today, when I picked up a new bag, and was griping about the cost and how cheap I am, the clerk at the feed store mentioned a cheaper alternative. Apparently they have a customer that buys chicken food, and uses that in her boxes. It's a grain based crumble that effectively works the same. The most compelling part being that 50# costs about $16.00, give or take. I got home, looked it up online and there are threads about how it works. I think I'll try that out next time.\n",

She was really worried before she came to visit that my house would smell of cats and liter but instead she wanted to know what that smell was...Lavender? she asked :)<br /><br />I have 5 liter boxes and 7 cats. The only time you might smell the urine is if you've left it gone a bit too long, and then not until  you start to scoop.<br /><br />I bought this liter because it is environmentally friendly.<br /><br />There is minimal dust and minimal tracking. Of course there is some, but it seems to travel far less then most.<br /><br />I have not observed any of my 7 very different personality cats eat any of it.<br /><br />They have a frequent buyer program, if you buy 12 of the same size and type you will get a free bag.<br /><br />(I've PurchaSed 40lb bag for $25-29 in my local area)\n",

      "Obviously, if you have a sensitivity to wheat, this would not apply to you. But as an asthmatic, I find litter box cleaning with clay litter to be unbearable. I end up coughing and wheezing from the dust and chemical perfumes. Luckily, this has never been an issue with this product. I started using Swheat Scoop in 2007, maybe before that, and I have never had any issues with dust or bugs.<br /><br />Frankly, the bug issue is not as big of a deal as I have been reading in other reviews. This is exactly what can happen with all-purpose flour too. These bugs are notorious for finding their way into pantries, and I am sure they can get into this litter if improperly stored in a warehouse. Just treat this litter like you already should be handling flour, wheat bread and similar food in your pantry, which is a place that is much more likely to have meal worm issues.<br /><br />The clumping is not the same as with clay litter. That is, the clumps don't form into one neat ball. But I don't find it hard to clean the box with this litter. It does actually clump and only forms a bunch of little balls as someone mentioned if you break it apart with the scooper. I use a very large scoop to prevent that. As for the smell, there is barely any scent to the litter itself and it only stinks if you are cleaning your box any less than once a day, which is not enough for any type of litter. The website actually had a couple of tips for clumping: adding cooking spray or a sheet of wax paper to the bottom of the box and sprinkling a bit of baking soda to help with clumping and odor.<br /><br />Since there are pros and cons to everything, you really have to weigh what you would rather deal with. In my experience, I would much rather deal with litter that does not clump neatly into one ball than with dusty, perfume-y litter that makes it hard to breath.\n",

      "I love this cat litter.<br /><br />It clumps well, has virtually no odor, and flushes easily. I don't dread changing the cat box anymore! I keep a small bucket and scoop next to the box and simply scoop the clumps every couple of days and flush them. No more stinky perfumes or plastic bags. It also seems to absorb the urine really well so I don't have the ammonia smell I had with Tidy Cats or Fresh Step. The clumps appear dry and scoop very easily.<br /><br />I have not noticed any bugs or anything like that...I did used to find tiny spiders in my old litter (Tidy Cats and Fresh Step).\n",

      "I'm a relatively new cat owner and admittedly have not used any other litter but this.<br />I was attracted to the fact that it's not clay, clumps and is flush-able.<br />Admittedly the odor isn't completely masked as they claim, but since we regularly scoop when home, and as long as we clean it every week and put in fresh litter, the smell is only notable if you put your face in the box.<br />Most importantly, our cat seems to like it, and in the month we've had her, she's had no adverse reactions to it (ie. no UTI problems).<br /><br />We live in a small apartment where space is limited. We bought a covered litter box, removed one of the doors from our under sink cabinet and put the box in it.<br />The fact that it's a covered box, in a cabinet, helps prevent the litter from tracking all over the place. The downside is that since our space is so small, we DO have to vacuum every time she uses the box, otherwise WE would be tracking it through the apartment!<br /><br />As far as reports of bugs, we haven't seen any evidence of a problem.<br /><br />Bottom line:<br />1) It's a great alternative to clumping clay litter (which can be harmful for your cat)<br /><br />2) There is some clean up necessary after your cat uses the box. Keeping a textured floor mat at the base of your litter box helps prevent it from \"traveling\".<br /><br />3) Odor coverage is minimal, but a good diet with the least amount of filler helps waste odor.<br /><br />4) I personally have not seen evidence of bugs of any sort.<br /><br />I hope this helps other first time cat owners!\n",

      "The litter is great -- clumps well, keeps smell down, the cats are happy with it. However, one of my cat's is a litter kicker and so it is everywhere (all over the house).  I have tile on the floor the litter box is on and the little granules (like sand but a little bigger) get into the grout and have eventually worn some of the more traveled areas down (some of the grouting is almost gone).  I've used Swheat Scoop about a year and half.  I sweep regularly but as I said, my cat is a kicker.  The other cat is just a magnet for any litter and carries it everywhere.  Ever have cat litter in your bed?  Yeah, you will if you use this.

      "Ah the controversial Swheat scoops litter!  Does it breed bugs?  Does it stick to the bottom of litter boxes?  Do pets gorge themselves on it?  You won't know until you try it in your home with your animals.  However, know this...  One of my cats love sleeping in it!  Ok now that I have your attention, keep reading.<br /><br />From my own trial and error instead of reading the instructions, Swheat Scoops likes to be used with a deep layer of about five or six inches or so in a normal box.  Otherwise, you get that odoriferous oatmeal cookie dough consistency stuck to the bottom of your litter box.<br /><br />The Litter Robot II doesn't work well with Swheat Scoops litter.  Unlike a conventional litter box, you can't simply add more than the recommended litter to the Litter Robot II.  If you add too much litter, the excess gets dumped into the waste receptacle.  And there in lies the problem.  Since the litter isn't deep enough, the cookie dough sticks to the flexible rubber bottom of the globe!  The cookie dough sticks so well to the rubber, that when the rubber flops out when the globe is fully inverted, the cookie dough won't let go!  That's sticky...  and Stinky too.<br /><br />So folks with normal boxes, double up the depth and you'll be fine.  People with Litter Robot II's, don't use it or you'll end up taking a litter scoop to your globe.  Quite ironic since didn't you want to stop using a litter scoop when you got your Litter Robot II?  Also, I noticed that my normal litter scooper didn't sift the excess swheat scoops too well.  It felt like I was tossing out a lot of the good with the bad.  So maybe a scoop upgrade is necessary too.\n",

I love it for them because I don't have to worry about asthma from the clay dust, that gross perfume smell, or intestinal blockages from licking their fur, or REALLY bad news if a dog gets into the box for 'cat treats'.  (Ok, the dogs do get diarrhea from eating too much wheat litter, but no intestinal blockages from clay!)<br />  I don't think it tracks more than other scoopables, but we also have it in the basement.  AND, you can spray your cleaned box with nonstick coating like Pam, and that will really help with sticking.  Also, I just tilt the scoop back and forth gently or use a small vibration technique to sift the loose litter and this way the clump stays together well.

      "I changed from a clay litter because of the amount of dust to the Swheat Scoop.  The SS has less dust than clay and it can be flushed down the toilet, however there are some drawbacks. I use the Omega Paw litter box with 3 inches of litter.  It does stick to the bottom with even 3 inches of litter, but with this type of box, I can bang the outside of box when it is upside down to free the bottom clumps. A good litter mat reduces the tracking outside the box.<br /><br />I feed my cats EVO and Wellness cat food but one cat has really stinky poo that overpowers the SS litter, so the odor control is average.  I learned to never feed Fish cat food to a Siamese cat, the odor is seriously bad. The extra strength Ever Clean worked better for poo odors, but it's very dusty and not flushable.  So far, I've have not noticed any bugs or mice getting into the litter box but it wouldn't surprise me if it happened due to the wheat.<br /><br />Plan to try the Feline Pine for a month with the Omega Paw box and see which one works better for minimizing fecal odors.  Since the litter box is near our bathroom, I would rather have a flushable, clumping litter.  I will use Arm and Hammer to control the odor and find ways to work around the stickiness and pest problems.\n",

      "I have been using this product for many years and I love it. Every so often I try another brand, but I always come back to Swheat. The odor control (my main issue with 4 cats) is outstanding, and the clumping is just fine. A friend of mine has multiple cats in a small apartment had a terrible odor problem, but would not take any of my advice. She was recently hospitalized and so I have been caring for her cats. I switched the litter to Swheat, and guess what. Odor problem solved overnight.<br /><br />I have no idea what these bad reviews are all about. I would imagine if bugs are an issue in your area, they might be attracted to Swheat. I live in a large city and do not have a bug issue, and have never seen bugs in or around the bag. I have never experienced any gooey mushiness, but I am guessing that if you do not use the litter properly this might happen. Here's the thing, and this pretty much goes for any litter. You must fill the litter pan with several inches of litter (3-4 in) in order to gain maximum benefit. Otherwise, how is it supposed to clump properly, or control odor? Covering the bottom of the pan with 1/2 inch is not proper use of any litter.<br /><br />I cannot imagine anyone, with proper use of this litter, not loving it. Best litter ever, that's all there is to it.\n",

      "Swheat Scoop absorbs liquid better than the original rock-type litter, keeps the litterbox smelling fresher than crystals and is much safer for the cats, my son and the environment than the latest super clumping, micro-fine, choke-on-the-dust stuff on the market.<br /><br />Yes, the litterbox still has the potential to stink but hey, look at what's going in that box! I have 3 adopted kittens that I am actively trying to plump up, so you can imagine what both of our litterboxes are like. However, I have noticed that by cleaning the boxes morning and night, the \"stinky\" is almost non-existent. I don't have to deal with the distinctive litterbox perfume overkill either (you know, the \"pretty\" smell).<br /><br />To ensure better clumping, take a note from those automatic cat boxes and do not scoop immediately after kitty goes potty. You do want to clean the box at least once a day, twice if you can manage it, because wet wheat litter will stick to the bottom of the box and/or bag just like the superfine clay type does. Not fun.<br /><br />As this is a natural wheat product, you do want to care for it a little more than traditional litter. Check the product as soon as you get home and then periodically re-check it just to make sure you don't have any uninvited and unwelcome little guests. You may also want to invest in some pantry pest traps, just in case, and place them wherever you plan to store the Swheat Scoop.<br /><br />There really isn't a \"perfect\" cat litter but I have to admit I was really tempted to give a five star rating. Two of my kittens are disabled and cannot control their hind legs very well. This means frequent accidents and sometimes a bit of shmutz. It is really nice to know that they aren't going to have super clumping clay clogging their little insides if they clean up before I get to them.<br /><br />Overall, I give Swheat Scoop a two thumbs up and a four star rating instead of five simply because of that slight bit of extra maintenance required.\n",

      "In reading the other reviews here, I'm wondering why I've never had these issues with Swheat Scoop.  It is the only litter I'll use for my cat.  Why?  Because clay cat litters are dusty, that dust gets in the cat's fur and when licked, goes directly into their digestive tract... and clumps.  My vet has told me of many cats he's treated that eventually died from blocked digestive tracts, due to a build up of clumped clay litter.  He's also advised me that the litters with the \"pearls\" of silicone can, if ingested, cause seizures and other potentially fatal reactions in cats, so I won't use those either.<br /><br />Swheat Scoop won't do that, plus it's much easier on the environment, won't harm anything if you flush it, it keeps the odors away, and it works.  Now, to address a few of the complaints I've seen here...<br /><br />Yes, if you put this in a litter box without a liner, the clumps stick like glue to the bottom.  Simple solution... use recycled or biodegradable liners.  It makes cleaning simple, fast, and much less traumatic.  I would never think to put this in an automatic litter box, because it's wheat, which contains gluten, which gets very clumpy when moist.  But then, I'd never use any CLUMPING litter in an automatic litter box, nor am I one who would ever buy an automatic litter box, either.  It's not that difficult to change a regular box if you use liners.<br /><br />Regarding tracking and the litter getting stuck in kitty's paws... I've never had that problem with my cat.  Sometimes he'll kick a little of the litter out of the box, but nothing the vacuum cleaner won't handle.<br /><br />I have used this for years and never, ever got any with bugs in it... nor have I ever had any issues with bugs getting in it after I opened it at home.  As for directions being found in the bottom of the container... it's simple... you empty the litter box, put in a new liner, fill it with Swheat Scoop about two inches deep, and you're done.  Very simple and very logical.  I scoop and flush the solid waste, then just lift liner and all out when fresh litter is needed.<br /><br />There is so little dust from this litter, you could probably call it dust-free.  However, I would think that anyone allergic or sensitive to wheat or wheat products would risk a reaction to the small amount of dust it makes.  I have all kinds of allergies (though not to wheat) and never once has Swheat Scoop adversely affected me, though.<br /><br />In a nutshell, this is the only litter I feel safe using for my cat... it's the one my vet recommended, it's safe for the environment and the plumbing, and it's the only one my cat actually likes now, too.  Swheat Scoop has a customer for life here!\n",

      "We tried Swheat Scoop strait off when we got our new kitten.  We liked it pretty well, but decided to shop around a bit.  We tried World's Best and were not impressed.  It was really light so she when she dug in litter box it ended up all over the ground, second, we did not enjoy the corn smell and did not feel like it masked odors as well as Swheat Scoop.  We next tried Feline Pine- we did not get through the whole box. It tracked everywhere!  Not to mention it did not clump at all.  So we are back to using Swheat Scoop.<br /><br />Reasons we like Swheat Scoop<br />-Controls oder wonderfully<br />-Does not track too much<br />-Is safe for little kitties<br />-Clumps well for easy scooping<br />-Is flushable!<br />-Is cheaper than other clay-free litters.\n",

      "My two Himalayans have been using Swheat Scoop for about three years now and it definitely has some pros and cons.  I truly do not think there is such thing as the perfect cat litter and you just have to decide which product is the best for you and your kitties.<br /><br />I was using Fresh Step and was worried about the chemicals and clay dust.  My cats are pretty easy going and will use anything I put out for them.  I didn't start them off slowly or mix cat litters. Instead I changed one box (I have two) to the Swheat Scoop to see if they'd go for it and they began using it immediately<br /><br />I am not nearly as diligent as I should be about cleaning the box. My cats are not siblings but they do the same exact things in the cat box (maybe it's the breed). Neither one will cover up what they do. This is kind of gross but the turds sit on top unless I go in and cover them. Thankfully they aren't super stinky so that's not really a problem for me. If I cover up the turds the litter doesn't really stick to it, it just sort of dries it out a bit. When I go to scoop them out, not much cat litter comes with them. They're like little rocks that I fish out.<br /><br />My cats also like to wee in the same spot on top of each other's pee. This is drawback number one. They never pee in the middle of the box, it's always right up against the side. They'll do it so much that it doesn't really clump but turns into a wet mushy mess. The loose clumps break apart easily and you really can't use a slotted scoop to get them out. I have a little plastic shovel it use to remove it. This is only when i let the cat box go for a few days. Every once in a while I have the opposite problem. They'll surprise me and go on the far side of the box and when I go to scoop it's like other reviewers have said, like wet cement. You almost have to chisel it off.<br /><br />Now on the odor control I have two issues.  If I don't clean as often as I should, there can be a strong ammonia odor after two or three days. It's a make your eyes water, burn your eyebrows off kind of smell. Mind you my cats pee in the same spot so my guess is that the litter can't really handle that. I tried the multi cat formula with the same results. It can be very bad and makes the task of cleaning the litterbox that much more unpleasant. I originally thought there was something wrong with my cats but my vet assured me they had no problems. The fix is to scoop every day and maybe several times a day. The other issue I have with the odor is probably more a mental thing for me. If I clean the box diligently (before the ammonia smell sets in) the cat box smells like Cheetos (the orange puffed cheese snack). It's very weird and has put me right off eating them (the Cheetos, not the litter). I would imagine it's because of the starch in the litter but I find it rather strange.<br /><br />The price is pretty reasonable. I buy the 14-17 lb. bags from PetsMart and it ranges in price from $9.99-11.99 depending on if I catch a sale. I live in the DC metro area so not sure if this is comparable to other areas. They sell a 40 lb bag but I'm a weakling and can't lift it by myself. This stuff is heavy. It's lighter than clay but still heavy. I like the 17 lb bags the best but they only have those sporadically.  I find the the 17 lb bag fills up my very large cat box nicely.  Or, one bag 14 lb plus a bit more will do the trick.  I can get it to last about one month before emptying, bleaching and refilling the box.<br /><br />This stuff tracks pretty badly but I've never had a scoopable cat litter that didn't. I sweep/vacuum it up daily which cuts down on some of the tracking. It's not fun to walk on since it's hard but it cleans up pretty easily. My box is in the bathroom so I probably track it more than my cats do.<br /><br />You can flush it but I don't do that since my toilet is low flow and clogs occasionally. I dispose of it in the trash. It's a little dusty when you first pour it into the cat box but not once it's in there.<br /><br />I did get a bag with bugs in it a while back and I didn't realize what they were or put two and two together. After reading other reviews I gather they were the wheat weevils. As soon as I saw the bugs I emptied the cat box, swept up the mess and used a fresh bag. Didn't have a problem with bugs after that.<br /><br />Overall this is a good product but don't expect perfection. For the price I feel like it's a good fit for me. My cats seem to like it, it's natural so I don't have to worry about them ingesting toxins and it cleans up pretty well if I stay on top of it. The price is reasonable and I can find it at some grocery stores now. I would reccommend trying it and seeing how you like it.\n",

      "Basically the title says it all. I read one review that said it was hard to remove from the bottom and sides of the litter box. I had the opposite experience. It's extremely easy to clean. I use a scooper and scoop out clumps and dump them into the toilet and flush away. No more bagging and smelly outdoor trash cans. It scraps off the bottom of the litter box very well, and very cleanly, leaving little behind. I used to use bags, but they usually wind up with holes anyway so now I just use the plain old litter pan with no bag and it's much easier to clean.<br /><br />In my experience, it does take a little longer to form clumps. Usually I don't even wait for that and just scoop out soft clumps and flush. Kitties have to have a very clean litter box or they'll eliminate anywhere except the litter box. I have two cats and wind up scooping 3-4 times a day. I keep it in the bathroom next to the toilet, so it's pretty convenient. It never clogs my toilet because it breaks up in the water and goes down easily.<br /><br />There is odor immediately after one goes poo, and if I'm home I just go clean it out immediately if I smell something. If I come home and find they've pooped, I'm pleasantly surprised because my house smells normal.<br /><br />My favorite perk of this kitty litter is that it's flushable. Second would be no perfume smell and no dust. I buy it in the 12 lb box and I've noticed considerably less dust than clay litter.<br /><br />You have to keep up with cleaning it, as with any kitty litter, but I've found this litter easier to clean and better for covering odors.\n",
      "1640\n",
      "I'm between two and three stars on this one.<br />My cat likes to bury her business really well, I guess, so she digs around a little bit after she uses the litter box. So far, this has completely destroyed the clumping effect. Instead of one or possibly two, giant, hard chunks for each time she pees like I would get with clay litters, I get about 15 teeny tiny ones. Since there are so many and they're so small, its nearly impossible to remove completely with scooping, so I could see how it could start to smell bad (I haven't been using it long enough to tell.) Scooping even one 'session' up also takes quite a while.<br /><br />However, so far it has done fine to control smells and the litter itself smells pretty good. It seems a little dusty, but no more than the litter, and I like that there is no strip mining involved in harvesting this product. I prefer having a box of it in my house to a box of the perfumey, dusty, dirty clay litter.  Also, my cat doesn't seem to mind it at all.<br />Unfortunately, the poor clumping ability will probably cause the litter to get dirty much faster than clay and need to be thrown out. Because of this, I'll probably keep trying different brands.<br /><br />I do want to like it, though, so I'm kind of just holding out and hoping my cat will decide she doesn't want to dig through her pee anymore. Yeah right.<br /><br />And on the bugs: Swheat Scoops website addresses this. They assure customers that the bags leave their facilities bug free and they go into detail about the process they use to kill any bugs. They say that bugs can only infest the product from warehouses. Perhaps getting it from certain stores will be more bug-free than others?\n",

      "I loved Swheat, but thought I'd check out the more-expensive alternative: World's Best corn litter.<br /><br />Both are a natural resource that supports our farmers.<br /><br />The wheat actually forms clumps that are as hard as rocks.<br />World's Best Corn Litter had slightly softer clumps.<br /><br />The wheat had an inert smell when new....but also never did start to smell for the 4 weeks it was in my two-cat's box.<br />World's Best Corn Litter has a yucky sour corn smell when new....and after just 3 days...it began to stink in the litter box. And yes, I'm at home all day so I scoop twice a day, sometimes more. Imagine how it would smell if it wasn't scooped very often, like so many cat owners do.<br /><br />Swheat was $8.99 for a big box at Walmart.<br />World best Corn Litter was $20 for a comparable size<br /><br />Swheat wins!<br />You may have just realized that World's Best (corn grain) litter is superior to clay and other litters....and it is.

The puppy food was distributed in the following 12 states: Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia.<br /><br />This is the third voluntary recall for the company this month. On April 6, the company recalled Diamond Naturals Lamb & Rice dry dog food made over possible salmonella contamination. On April 26, the company expanded the recall to its Chicken Soup for the Pet Lover's Soul Adult Light formula dry dog food.<br />So far, no dog illnesses have been reported, the FDA said.<br /><br />Pets infected with salmonella can become lethargic and have diarrhea or bloody diarrhea, fever and vomiting, according to the FDA. Infected pets can also pass the illness on to other animals or humans. Pet owners also can contract the illness from handling contaminated pet products, especially if they have not thoroughly washed their hands after handling the pet food.<br /><br />For more information about the recall, see [...].\n",

Highly rated<br />2. Cost less than $1/lb<br />3. My weimaraner both likes it and his stomach tolerates it (weims are known for having weak stomachs and allergies)<br /><br />Using dogfoodadvisor.com, I compared the five-star brands to the pricing available online; I found no dog food that cost less than $1/lb. So I began to look at four-star brands; there were only three that I could find for less than $1/lb. and two of those weren't widely available (I'm not driving an hour for dog food). So I \"discovered\" Diamond Naturals Beef & Rice at a price of $31.79 for a 40 lb bag (Amazon Prime price, shipping included). That's 79¢/lb.<br /><br />One criterion left: my dog had to both tolerate and like the food. Weimaraners are apparently known for having weak stomachs and allergies, so I was worried about spending $40 to find out. This has not been an issue; even better, Maxwell LOVES it.

Not an easy feat! So many foods I found at stores advertised catch phrases like a \"natural\" and \"organic,\" but still started with a non-meat ingredient.<br /><br />I found Blue Diamond at a great Austin grocery store in bulk for about $1 a pound and decided to make the switch. My dog isn't a picky eater; he loved the new food, but he'd probably get excited about anything different. When I moved out of state, I was afraid I wouldn't be able to find this brand, but Amazon saved the day again! Now I'm paying about 79 cents a pound for the beef flavor (which he likes just as well as the lamb) vs. $1.76 for the Newman's Own.<br /><br />The only downfall: I think this food may have given him bad breath - I noticed a certain oral aroma that seems to have started about the time we switched, but I'm not confident enough to say it was definitely from the food. Still, I'm giving him Proden Plaqueoff Animal now. It apparently takes a long time to work, but I think I've seen a bit of improvement over the last few weeks.

She can't get enough of it. Whereas before I was lucky if she ate 2 ounces of food, she now eats everything in her bowl. Since she's still a kitten, I feed her as much as she wants. I'm really grateful for this product, which I think will help get her back to a normal weight.\n",

So I started off with the Natural Balance cans and my kitten was doing just fine. However, I did notice he was never too enthusiastic about feeding time. I decided to chip in a couple more cents and get the wellness food and it's like he's CONSTANTLY hungry now.<br /><br />Bottom line is, if the cat likes it, thats great because it's just as healthy.

My vet recommended weaning her onto a healthy, high protein, wet cat food. I had been feeding her cheap dry food.<br /><br />My cat absolutely LOVES this stuff! As soon as it arrived, I opened a can of it, just to see what it smelled like. THIS STUFF SMELLS FINE! I think that is smells BETTER than most cans of cat food that I have opened. It does NOT stink-up my house at all.<br /><br />My cat does not usually eat a whole 6oz can of wet cat food in a day, but she will happily gobble up as much of this as I give her each day!

The cats are all happy with it, I've heard no palatability complaints, and they're all in great health.  They get this in addition to Taste of the Wild dry food.  I'm really happy with this product for my needs, but I'll admit, if I was feeding just one or two cats I'd use the same brand I feed my dogs.<br /><br />10/11/12  What the heck!?

      "I recently was looking for a good brand of canned food to add to my cat's diet. Both my cats get dry food in the morning and wet food at night. I liked Felidae because it wasn't too expensive and seems to have excellent ingredients. I would have gone with the grain free option except for the cost. I went to a local pet food supplier to pick up a can of this before I bought a whole case (after reading reviews that some cats won't eat it) and luckily both of mine LOVED it. My male cat has had problems with urinary issues in the past and I wanted to get him off prescription food onto something better so both my cats now get Wysong Uretic dry food in the morning (because I am still paranoid about the struvite crystals my cat had) and Felidae at night. I also plan on switching every other case with Nature's Variety because that is also an excellent food that my cats love. Glad to find a good canned food at an economical price!<br /><br />I originally wrote this review in December. It is now the end of February, and both of my cats are refusing to eat the Felidae food. Luckily I only have 3 cans left from the case I bought, but 2 cans have completely gone to waste. Not sure why my cats suddenly won't eat it, the food looks the same and smells the same as the previous cans from the case. The only thing I can think of is the Nature's Variety food that I am also feeding them is better and they prefer that so they are refusing to eat the Felidae. I have since switched my cats onto all canned food, so it is possible that they only like this when it is offered every once in a while compared to every day or two. I still like the food for the price and ingredients, but unfortunately I won't be buying any more.\n",

      "Ive been quite happy with Felidae canned products.<br /><br />They are reasonably inexpensive if you look at the price per oz which you should always do.<br /><br />The ingredients are noteworthy for several reasons.<br />1) Because of very limited grains.  Cats cant process grains but you have to have something to hold the kibble together. They use alfalfa and brown rice which is better than corn.<br /><br />2) No meat by-products or even 'meal'.  Meal/byproducts could be anything pretty much.  It could be perfectly fine organ meat that humans don't eat a lot of, so theres a good supply.  It could be feathers, gristle, whatever.  It's generally best to avoid when possible.<br /><br />3) The first seven ingredients are meat-based.  This means a very limited amount of filler as an 8th ingredient could only theoretically be less than 12.5% of the whole product by weight.<br /><br />4) The variety of meats is also beneficial, especially inclusion of liver which is nutritious.<br /><br />It is a good idea to feed your cat at least some canned wet food to ensure kitty gets enough water.  We also feed her some dry food as snacks, and have a pet fountain (steel) to encourage water drinking.<br /><br />Best of all, my cat loves it!\n",

      "I  fed this food during the hottest days of summer, as it has a lot of moisture to it. I prefer to feed dry food, but every other or every third day I have been feeding Felidae. During the hottest weeks one can was all I needed for four cats. A fourth of a can filled them up at once, though sometimes they came back a couple hours later and finished the portion. I feed under, and to the side of the air conditioner to keep the food fresher during the hottest days.<br />Then they also have a pan of dry food in the bedroom, and another in the kitchen.<br />I feel very confident with Felidae because of it being made in the United States.<br />I have rinsed out the can and poured some of the water in with the food. Big mistake, they won't eat it. They won't eat it with anything mixed in it, i.e. pieces of cooked chicken.<br />Straight from the can they seem to really like both flavors I have been buying.\n",

      "I have known for a long time that Canidae is a great product, and is not usually sold in stores, so when I saw these biscuits on the Amazon website, I immediately ordered them.  I have two Eskies (miniature American Eskimo Dogs) so I had to have enough for both of them.  This is a big package, so it was definitely enough.  Canidae is so highly rated for both dry and \"wet\" food that I didn't have to worry about these biscuits containing anything that might not be good for my Girls.<br /><br />It has \"Balanced Omega 6 & 3 Fatty Acids\" and they are advertised to help control tartar and plaque.  Can't speak to that yet (neither has had a dental for a year) but I do know they love them.  It's a single biscuit that can be snapped into 4 separate pieces.  My Girls, both under 26 pounds, receive 2 half-pieces in the mid-afternoon (that's 1 biscuit broken into 2 pieces) and although one of them trots off with her half-piece as soon as she gets it, the other stands right where she is and crunches down the first half-piece and looks for the next one (just about demands it!).<br /><br />As the package ran low I knew I had to have more for them, and so re-ordered from Amazon.  Another package duly arrived, before the first one ran out, for which I was thankful.  And so were The Girls!\n",

      "I was looking for a bulk price bargain on my preferred premium dog biscuit for my two Vizslas & this definitely met that criteria. Canidae's Snap Biscuits always have some bits and pieces in the bottom of the bag, which is understandable since the biscuit is a snap variety. I was afraid the larger quantity might mean more waste & I was right. There were three (3) plastic 4# bags in a large single cardboard box to comprise the 12#, so they must shuffle a bit & in the end the amount of tiny bits & powdery crumbs in the bottom of each bag was a significant amount of waste. Though I'm sure I could use the wasted crumbs in their food bowl, I am very careful to watch their food intake at meal time.<br /><br />I love the nutrition & quality of Canidae's Lamb & Brown Rice Snap Biscuits, but I will likely stick with the single 4# units in the future, which are packed in individual bags.\n",

      "Wellness is a food we like for our dogs both because of what's in it and what's not in it. Why does it cost a little more than some other foods? Think about what's not in it. No meat-by-products. No wheat. No corn. No white rice. No artificial colors, flavors, or preservatives.<br /><br />Our bichon had been having major problems with itching and skin allergies. Our vet suggested we put her on a bland diet and gradually introduce foods to determine the cause or causes or her discomfort. One day an employee at a local pet store suggested we try Wellness with whitefish and sweet potato. I wasn't sure about feeding fish to our dogs but gave it a try.<br /><br />The switch to this Wellness formula was a great success. Evie loves the flavor of this recipe and eats it eagerly. While on the Wellness diet her itching and scratching decreased tremendously.

The more agreeable kitty was happy to switch to PetGuard...the other one needs a little encouragement, but I expected that.<br /><br />I am tired of worrying about what might be in the food I'm giving my pets, and I've been alarmed not only by the current pet food recalls, but also by the apparently low standards of consumer protection held by the mainstream mass-market industry.  So, I decided to switch to PetGuard.  Though, while making the switch, I will probably have to supplement it just a little with the cats' old favorites (Fancy Feast fish types) so they make the change-over smoothly.<br /><br />I've tried at least one other all-natural brand (I think it was Wellness) -- they wouldn't touch it.  Can't blame them -- it was smelly!  This pet food, the PetGuard, has no foul smell.<br /><br />I bought PetGuard dry food, too, and that is being received well.<br /><br />We have dogs...have switched their food, too, from Alpo to PetGuard, and they like it so far.

      "I've been using Swheat Scoop for years - switched from World's Best(which, alas, had too much dust for me.  Swheat Scoop is fine with the cats and doesn't get tracked around as much as some other brands.<br /><br />There is a problem with food moth and other bug infestations in our now hotter summers. Cure: crumple up a few bay leaves in the open litter tray and pop a few in the bag of unused litter.  This also works to protect your herbs, dried beans, grains, etc.\n",
      "1785\n",
      "Interesting to read the other reviews - especially the ones that comment about the bugs.  We've been using Swheat Scoop since we adopted our cat in May of 2010 and haven't had a single problem with it.  There is only one local retailer that carries it and only in box form.  Maybe the bags can be infiltrated more easily by the bugs? Maybe it's the timing of maufacture and the environmental conditions at the factory or warehouse, and maybe its the location of the end-use litterbox and environmental conditions of the space? Or any combination of aforementioned possibilities... or I'm way off. Regarless, observations noted and I will look for problems in future batches - I'll make sure to add bay leaves as noted by another reviewer.<br /><br />I certainly won't plan on changing anytime soon, however, even with the chance of bugs.  This stuff is wonderful.  Grew up with cats and volunteered at a shelter. Will never buy clay again - the dust is awful and the fragrance even worse.  After several years of keeping their cat's box in a storage room, my parents found there was a layer of light, perfumy dust on EVERYTHING when they pulled the boxes and began sorting items for a rummage sale. Just think about that getting circulated around the house! They did try another natural litter after my experience with Swheat Scoop and ended up switching a short time later to this brand and are very glad they did. It only sticks to the bottom when the level starts to get low - so I add more and its fine again.  I try to scoop something every other day - may be a few days in between if life gets busy, but there is still not that much odor. It clumps nicely; however, I try to scoop when I know my cat hasn't used the box in a while just to make sure that the clumps have time to set up. Never had a problem otherwise. Flushing can sometimes be a problem if I get impatient and overload the bowl and then fail to let it soak and soften for a few minutes. But this particular toilet has issues, too.<br /><br />Bottom Line: Love this stuff, so do my parents; we'd recommend to anyone.\n",

      "I'm a two-cat mom and have been a clumping clay litter user for decades. I came a bit late to the natural litter party, because I was afraid natural litters would clump poorly/smell bad etc. Swheat Scoop is the second natural litter I've tried, and I had planned to try them all but this stuff is so great that I've decided there's no need to look further.<br /><br />There is no such thing as a cat litter that never smells bad, has no dust, never tracks at all, and produces clumps so perfect that they neither stick to the side/bottom of the box nor crumble apart a bit. That said, Swheat Scoop is the closest to perfect I've ever found, in ALL of these respects.<br /><br />Smell: Slightly \"barnyard\"-like (it is wheat, after all), but I only notice it when I'm scooping out the box; if you scoop daily, you will not have an ambient smell. (We live in a 1-BR condo and the litter box is in the bathroom, so I would notice if there was a lingering smell.)<br /><br />Dust: Hands down, the least dusty litter (clay or natural) I've ever tried.<br /><br />Tracking: Minimal, on par with the lowest-tracking clay litters I've used, and superior to the lightweight (pine/cedar) natural litters. Swheat Scoop's consistency is quite like Grape Nuts cereal (sorry to gross out anyone who eats Grape Nuts), so because the granules are on the heavier side they tend not to track.<br /><br />Clumps: Not perfectly tight, but they can be scooped easily enough. With a high volume of urine, the clumps do stick to the bottom/sides a bit, but in my experience the tighter-clumping clay litters adhere MUCH more to the bottom and sides. (One of our cats pees a ton and the side-sticking drove me nuts with clay litter.) And as another reviewer mentioned, keeping the litter level high enough definitely mitigates this problem.<br /><br />I haven't experienced the bug problem others mentioned, but I'm willing to risk it considering how great this stuff is.\n",

The hypo-allergenic treats did not cost much more than the regular ones at the time I first bought them, so I figured I would be safe and buy them.

      "I have an 8 year old female German Shepherd. Lately I have been noticing she has a bit of a difficult time getting up and her hips always seem to be stiff.<br />Since I don't know anything about dog vitamins, I decided to take the route of these treats. I would much rather give her something she might possibly like over giving her a pill.<br /><br />Thing is, she doesn't really like these very much. I usually have to try 2 or 3 times to get her to eat. Bright side is that I can get her to eat them after a little hassle.<br /><br />The even brighter side to these treats (and the reason why I gave it 4 stars instead of 3) is the fact that they do seem to be helping her stiff joints. I have only gone through one 6 oz bag of these treats and I have noticed a difference in how she stands up, walks and runs. For the first time in a while her legs don't look so stiff.<br /><br />P.S. you can get these treats cheaper on Linens and Things website(LNT.COM). You don't have to pay shipping. I paid 12.21 for a pound of these treats.\n",

      "When my vet told me my little Yorkie had stage IV luxating patellas (knees blown out), I was devastated. The vet told me to give her Glucosamine & Chondrotin. I went to the local pet chain and spent a considerable amount for the \"chicken flavor\" tablets. For such a large chain, tablets were the only product they carried. They are hard tablets not easily broken in half for a small (7lbs) dog.  On top of that, she wouldn't have anything to do with them, took her little nose and pushed them away. I had to start crushing them and hiding them in a piece of people food. It was such an annoyance, I began a search for a different product form and found Zuke's online.  They are soft, she can't wait for her Zuke's treat every day! No more crushing, I still have the tabs left and will now only use Zuke's. The product also includes beef, fruits, vegetables and more. I am so happy with this product, I will continue to use it. My little Echo has perked up, jumps, runs and one would never know she has this condition.  This condition, at this stage, is correctable only by surgery; thousands of dollars which I don't have. I thank the founder of this company, Patrick in memory of his dog Zuke. They also donate to the Dog & Cat Cancer Fund. I know this is a long review, but that's just because this product really deserves kudos.<br /><br />As a side note, my pain management physician also recommended \"Golden Aloe\" daily to help with the arthritic pain that sets in with this diagnosis. So she both and is doing well. She's my best friend, I'm on disability and won't be able to afford the surgery if and when it's required so I am really relying on these products to keep her comfortable for as long as possible and she is only 3 years old.\n",

      "We've been feeding our Bichon Zuke's hip action treats for years.  He gets one each day after breakfast and expects it.  He has had two knee operations which was one reason we looked for a treat targeted for joints, etc.<br /><br />I only rated a 4 because I have no idea if the Zuke's hip action really does work in terms of improved mobility.  Yes, he loves the treats; yes, he walks every day; and yes, we're hoping the Zuke's is working to aid his mobility.  Nevertheless, he loves the Zuke's treat and we like the fact that they're made in the USA and are natural.  Just note of caution for Bichon owners with urinary stone issues; don't feed a Bichon beef products.  The chicken is great.<br /><br />UPDATE 04/17/10<br />I've updated my rating to a 5 because I recently took our dog to the vet who confirmed, at the age of 12 going on 13, he has no arthritis.  In fact, both front and back legs have full mobility.  I do attribute part of this success to his walking every day but also to Zuke's hip action treats.  Digby's had a Zuke's hip action treat for years and this treat is the only joint action remedy we feed him in addition to Nupro All Natural Dog Suppplement for his other nutrients, minerals, and vitamins.  While Zuke's hip action treats are not the only reason he is doing so well, I believe this treat in conjunction with exercise and the proper diet have significantly contributed to his overall well being!\n",

So then I read others reviews on Amazon and found Zuke's. I immediately bought it and gave her 2 doses a day for a week. And now she is running around the house ans jumps again.

      "Knowing his mother's agony, my son let his dog remain at home when he moved out, and, already spoiled, Raider became the center of our world. We would do anything for him and he returned our love tenfold. At the age of 12, our little pupcake began *screaming* whenever attempting to rise from sleep. Throughout that year his pain grew far greater...my husband and I were *forced* to have \"that talk\".  How much pain was too much pain? Were we just letting him live because we couldn't bear to let him go?<br /><br />On a trip to Utah, our friends saw the anguish overwhelming us.  They recommended we try Zuke's.  HOURS later, Raider was *running* for the first time in years!  He is now a happy 17-year-old, and ONLY ran into trouble the ONE time his Mommy was late in refilling the Zuke's. I kid you naught, the screaming is GONE, and has been since Day One.  We owe *so* much to that awesome hiker who owned Zuke and developed this 'treat' to help him out. As much as we wouldn't wish pain on anyone, we're so thankful Zuke had *such* a smart Daddy!!!\n",

      "Our older dog, Broccoli, has been quietly aging.  Sleeping on the couch instead of the bed, not jumping up, rarely playing...it all started so gradually we didn't really notice until he was virtually sleeping all day.  His hips were so stiff when he walked, his gate stilted and he never ran anymore.<br /><br />A friend and I were talking about his decreased mobility a few weeks ago and she recommended we try glucosamine and chondroitin, so we purchased Zuke's Hip Action (beef.)  After two weeks of feeding him a double dose, we've noticed a HUGE change.  While some stiffness in his hips is still evident, he's been running around, jumping on the bed, jumping up on his back legs and playing much more often and for longer periods of time.  Where he would once play for a few seconds and then lie down, he's now begging to play and run around.  I can't wait to see his progress in a month.  We plan to reduce the amount to the one treat a day (recommended for his size) after 6 weeks, per recommendations I've read online.  We're also giving a treat to our new puppy every day to ward off any future problems and keep his joints healthy (he's a greyhound mix with really long legs, so we're concerned about the various bone/joint problems that he could be prone to.)<br /><br />As far as taste, both dogs LOVE these treats, more than any other we've tried in fact.  We'll be giving Zuke's as a daily supplement from now on, as we're firm believers in the benefits of them.  I'm so glad to see my old friend acting like a puppy again.  Thank you Zuke's!\n",

      "My 10 lbs chihuahua/doxie mix is a picky eater.  He isn't motivated by food at all, and it's always a trial and error when it comes to trying out a new treat.  His treats of choice are freeze-dried tripe, freeze-dried liver, freeze-dried chicken - you get the idea.  The boy has expensive taste - lol.<br /><br />That said, since he's now nearing the 9 year old mark, I wanted to begin giving him Glucosamine and Chondroitin for his hips and joints.  I started to notice that he has become a little reluctant to jump up on the bed, preferring to be helped up.  I think this is happening due to getting older. My usage of these treats is to help with prevention - better to start early before it's too late, you know?<br /><br />Feeding him pills is a hassle, and I'm already giving him globs of peanut butter a day to hide his <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0015GS0BY\">Nutri-Vet Healthy Vision Canine Chewables</a> (I highly recommend these pills if you have a dog with vision issues).  Anyway, my quest for a non-pill form of Glucosamine and Chondroitin led me to Zuke's Hip Action.<br /><br />I love that it's wheat, corn and soy free.  My boy has skin allergies and I've been doing my best to keep his diet as clean as possible.  Each treat has 300 mg of Glucosamine and 50 mg of Chondroitin.  The treats also have antioxidants thanks to cherry, blueberry, rosemary, turmeric and seasame seed.  BTW - turmeric is a great Indian spice that also helps humans because of its anti-inflammatory benefits.  It also has egg shell membrane meal, which according to the package helps support joint health.  So, it has good stuff in it.  It's also made in the USA.  After all the issues with Chinese-made dog treats, avoiding treats from China is important to me and the health of my dog.<br /><br />For a small 46 lbs and under dog (like my Ozzy), only one treat is necessary per day.  For a medium dog of 98 lbs and under, 2 treats a day is necessary.  For a giant dog of 138 lbs and under, 3 treats are needed per day.  Each package has about 23 treats in it.  If you have a larger size dog, it definitely can get pricey.<br /><br />I feed Ozzy the peanut butter flavor, because, well, peanut butter is one of his favorite things in the world.  Each treat is square and has a moist look to it.  It has an interesting smell - not one of my favorites, but not completely a turn-off either.  Just...interesting.  But the best part is he LOVES them.  His eyes actually bug out more than the usual chihuahua buggy-eyed look, and he happily grabs it and runs off to enjoy it.  He looks forward to it every day.<br /><br />Ozzy recently had surgery on his ear, and during the time after his surgery, he was pickier than ever with food.  He refused to eat even the raw beef patties that he usually loves.  He barely even took the peanut butter hiding his eye vitamins, probiotics and antibiotics (and this is a dog that loves peanut butter)  But these Zuke treats?  Heck yeah! Never a problem.  Just goes to show how much he loves these treats.\n",

He loves these and they seem to help him a lot. When I pull out the bag, he starts doing his tricks hoping I'll give him one just for doing them! He can eat them easily even without the majority of his teeth, although I do break them into smaller pieces since he is only about 5 pounds.<br />These treats seem to have really improved his mobility and stamina. He skips less(to get his kneecap back in place), bunny hops less(because his hips hurt him), and jumps on the bed without any help(he used to stand on the top of his pet stairs and wait for me to pick him up). He's always had tons of energy, but now his body can keep up with him better.\n",

      "I rescued my havanese dog from a breeder who was going to put her down for a hip deformity. Turns out the hip was fine but the ball on her leg bone was broken sometime when she was a puppy. It caused her immense pain when moved in certain positions and caused her to limp. Running fast was out of the question and jumping was only for the lowest of heights. Even when she sat her left leg would be out to the side at an awkward angle. She was stuck in a catch 22. She couldn't make it stronger because it hurt and it hurt because it was so weak.<br /><br />We tried glucosamine supplements, but they were powdery and she seemed to not like the taste. The chicken jerky with glucosamine all seemed to be from china with an FDA advisory for liver and kidney problems.<br /><br />That's when I found Zukes hip action. The first time I opened the package the dog danced on her hind legs just to get a better sniff. The squares are soft and dense. They split into smaller pieces easily for training or to extend the reward time. The dog is sure to find even the smallest crumb. These treats last a long time with a small/medium sized dog like mine.  The bag makes a satisfying crinkle sound the dogs listens for. I really like that they are high quality and made in America.<br /><br />The improvement began immediately and after a few weeks of daily treats the difference was in the use of her hind leg was amazing. More cushion and flex in her hip let her use her leg more. Now she is much more active with better behavior and lots more running and jumping. She even sits down with both legs under her. Another thing I noticed was when she would lay in her bed on her back her bad leg would be pulled in. Now both legs spread out like normal for easier tummy rubs. When she is being silly she even army crawls. I only wish we had found them sooner. If you saw this dog running around you would never know she had a hip problem in the past.\n",

I didn't like the Turkey flavor as much; they were drier and less tasty. I would recommend the Natural Balance Dog Food Roll Lamb Formula to any Rottweiler, but I won't share mine.<br /><br />Conclusion: Absolutely the best training treat I've ever had! Liver treats are good, but they can be too rich and upset my stomach. Plus dad says these are WAY cheaper than the liver treats.\n",

      "I've been using this cup/filter combo everyday for 2 months or so.  The cup is nicely constructed and I have no problems with it.<br /><br />However, the filter does not perform very well if you use tea leaves that are very small.  I drink PG Tips loose leaf everyday, 3 times a day.  The leaves are fine and the holes at the bottom of the filter allow the tiniest tea particles to fall through.  If this doesn't bother you, the system works.  If you don't like tea particles at the bottom of your clear cup, it will begin to annoy you.  I bought this system thinking that the few flakes at the bottom of the cup would not bother me but i have resorted to using the filter in another cup and pouring the leaf-free liquid into my drinking cup because there are many unfiltered leaves at the bottom of the cup.  Imagine the entire bottom of the cup covered in the tiniest leaf particles...<br /><br />Also, the filter stains easily.  After two months, there is a hint of yellow orange stain on the side filters.<br /><br />Therefore, if you use larger tea leaves, this system may work decently for you.

      "Some sediment will fall through the bottom but i found that this usually occurs when you first put the tea in the yo yo.  Solution:  Hold the Yo Yo over your tea container/tin while while loading it.  Then, give it a little shake so that it settles and anything that will fall out falls back into your possession for later use.  Once it is all in there very little falls out.  Then, when you add the water, the tea swells up a bit making it very difficult to get through the small holes.<br /><br />The cup is larger than i'm used to but it's a welcomed change.  I'm not sure what size Big Gulp cups the below reviewer is using for his or her tea, but this one is certainly adequate.  Also, i really like watching the tea brew through the clear glass.  It comes with a cover that also acts as a base that you can set the Yo Yo on.  This will eliminate any mess made by dripping.<br /><br />Cleaning the Yo Yo, for me, involves turning it upside down and give it a couple soft taps against the included cover/base.  The tea usually just falls right out on command.  A quick rinse in the sink and it looks brand new again.<br /><br />And oh, by the way, it makes a great cup of tea.\n",

The white plastic of the mesh is surprisingly impervious to staining, and the plastic structure is strong and flexible. It's not the finest mesh I've come across so some dust will end up in your tea, but it's as good as most of the commercial filters.<br /><br />The lid that helps keep steeping heat in the infusor when steeping doubles as a holder for the infusor when you take it out of the tea.

      "It absolutely amazes me that some people spend over two dollars for a single cup of coffee, yet still buy those low cost tea bags from the grocery store, and then claim to like coffee better.  Many people have not tasted a real good cup of tea.  Good tea does not come in a 200 count per cardboard box - the tea should have higher quality and shouldn't be in a cheap cardboard box at all.  It should be in a sealed tin or packed in an airtight bag in order to preserve the flavor, and the leaves should be specially selected.  The cheapest teas are bought in bulk from the lowest quality teas parts of the tea leaf.  Yes, cost does matter in tea, just like coffee.<br /><br />Unless you're really lazy (which, I admit, I am), teas should also never, ever, be served from a bag.  Teas should be in loose form, not confined in a bag.  Why?  Because tea leaves need to expand in the water to release their full flavor.  You can buy loose tea leaves buy on amazon, high end grocery store, or in specially markets (e.g. Cost Plus), or tea shoppes.<br /><br />Now, unless you want to brew a whole pot with tea leaves in the plot, there are not many ways to make tea right for just one person.  This mug solve the single serving dilemma.  It's big, sturdy, and made of glass.  The most important thing though is that it comes with an infuser.  It looks like a cylindrical filter that is placed into the mug.  Just spoon a bit of the tea into the filter, dunk in the mug, and the tea will be brewed right then and there.  The result is some of the best tea you'll have ever drank.  The brewing is really easy, add tea to the filter, and add sub boiling hot water, wait, remove the infuser, and drink.  If you need to add sugar or cream, well, that's your choice, but I believe the right tea needs none of that.<br /><br />To make tea, place one to two spoonfuls in the filter, then pour in 160 degree water for green, steeped for a little less than 2 minutes, 180 degrees for white tea, steeped for over 5 minutes, and about 200 degrees for black or oolong, steeped for about three to four minutes.  No - you don't have to measure the temperature each time, only when first starting out.  Just bring the water to boiling, then let it cool down  until the desired temperature is reached.  Count those seconds.  Next time you make tea, boil, wait for those amount of seconds and then pour in the mug.  Easy.<br /><br />I suggest trying different teas (without adding anything), until you find your right one.  My personal favorite is Green Well Green Tea, but I still have a lot to try.<br /><br />Tea is like wine, cheese, coffee, or beer.  Quality and tastes vary tremendously, and if you only try the cheap stuff, you'll never really enjoy it like you should.\n",

      "I got this little guy as a small Xmas present, and have been pleased with it.  Very useful.  I agree with small bits of tea comments above through the holes in the bottom of the infuser, but it's such a small amount that it wouldn't cause anyone trouble.  The general ergonics of the design are lacking.  It's quite hard to hold by the handle, with no way to leverage the cup vertical (fingers slip down the handle).  Only way I can figure out is to hold the cup itself, fingers through the handle but only near the very tip of the rim when hot.  Needless to say, I enjoy using it, and the lip does have some significance to it, so it can be held in this manner quite easily.<br /><br />Looking forward to many tea infusions at work now, and moving up to better loose teas in purchases.  :)\n",

      "As far as a tea strainer goes, it certainly works<br /><br />other people have commented that while the sides of this thing are a fine mesh perfect for the role, that the bottom allows the powder to drop through, leaving a sediment at the bottom of your tea.  This is correct, and is what makes this product a 4 star product instead of 5.<br /><br />Personally, I have no problems with this, but if you do, search on.  Other than that little issue, it has been fantastic.<br /><br />I drink approximately five cups of tea per day\n",

      "I have recently been brewing my own herbal blend infusions, not actually tea, and have found this mug to fit my needs.  The mug is simple and streamlined, and very easy to use.  I appreciate the mug and infuser design, which is sturdy and clean.<br /><br />I simply boil my water in the glass in the microwave, add my herbal blend to the infuser basket, and dunk the basket into the mug.  I let it set for however long I want, then reheat in the glass as appropriate, and enjoy.<br /><br />My only concern is that the infuser would be nice if it had a plunger mechanism.  I just press the herbs with a spoon to get the full flavor.  Also, the mug does not hold heat, and I usually like my infusion boiling hot!<br /><br />All in all, this is a great product, which I anticipate much use out of.\n",
      "1999\n",
      "This is a nice quality cup and infuser -- it's sturdy and comfortable.  The infuser is resistant to staining and the little lid that is used to keep the heat in when steeping can be turned upside-down to act as a holder for the wet infuser when you remove it from the tea.<br /><br />However, there are some problems.  My main complaint is the design of the infuser.  The sides are a nice, fine mesh whereas the bottom is plastic with some perforations.  These holes in the bottom allow small leaf bits to flow-out.  I have a Teeli infuser that has the mesh in the bottom also and it keeps all of the leaves contained.  Second, and far more minor, the cup is rather small.  It makes a nicely sized cup of tea, but if you're used to drinking from larger cups and mugs, you will find yourself gulping this one down pretty quickly.<br /><br />Overall, this is not a bad product and if it had the full mesh infuser, I would have given it 4 stars.\n",

Without going into minute detail of what makes the film brilliant- the classic score,  the hilarious comedy and Burton's twisted but brilliant vision- the quality of the film transfer to DVD is almost criminal. It probably wouldn't be noticed on television screens smaller than 27 inches, but on larger screens the picture becomes soft and grainy, devoid of detail and utterly perplexing, given that the movie was shot in the late 80's. The first thought that sprang to my mind when watching it was that it almost immediately reminded me of my time in elementary school before we switched to video tape- the transfer is reminiscent of an old, battered 8mm film reel. I own a S-VHS vcr, and I have seen better film transfers on video tape. Additionally, the extras... well, what extras? There are several paragraphs of \"production notes\" which are basically brief overviews of Danny Elfman and Tim Burton, but nothing you couldn't gleam from Wikipedia in three minutes.<br /><br />All that aside, I did pay $9 for it at Sam's Club, so the old axiom of getting what you pay for is truer than ever- but I expected so much more.

      "OK...so I wrote my review too early.  Since the initial 'capture', I have bagged a couple more of the furry garden  terrorists.  Unfortunately, their relatives continue to excavate in and around my garden.  The problem: the trip mechanism is not sensitive enough (as I suspected and wrote in my initial post).  My catch rate is less than 10%, and I usually find the unsuccessful sets filled with dirt and untripped.  I just ordered 6 Macabee traps and will post a review there after a few days of using them.<br /><br />Initial post: \"I have pocket gophers running amuck in and near my vegetable garden.  Tried the smoke bombs without success.  After watching a number of videos on You Tube about trapping gophers, I decided to take a whack at it.  At two different sites, I found new mounds, probed for the main trench, excavated, set traps in each direction, wired the traps to a stake, and replaced the sod.  18 hours later, the first set had caught a gopher BY THE TAIL!  One clunk on the head with a shovel and I was on the board! The other set, I presume, was not placed deep enough in the hole as the gopher simply pushed dirt up into my trap.  The only drawback that I perceive about the product is that the bump plate requires a pretty hard 'bump' to spring the trap.  But, with one gopher in the bag after the first 18 hours, I am willing to keep using!\"\n",

One mole can do an incredible amount of damage.<br /><br />5/31/10 update:<br /><br />New season, new mole appears. Instead of using the mole trap, I tried a new approach--- kill his food source. One application of grub and insect killer and the mole is gone, probably to the neighbors yard. Everything I read on the internet suggest that you have to kill the mole but that has remained elusive except by luck. Getting rid of his food source though worked immediately.

Repeat in one week to kill hatchling fleas.  Let dry before letting pets back in.  Has no smell.<br /><br />Spray your mattress with Ultracide and under cabinets.  This has a strong smell. Do not spray this near animals as they have sensitive noses!  Let dry and aerate house.<br /><br />Wash animals with Eqyss Microtek Shampoo and Eqyss Premiere Conditioner. Give dogs Comfortis orally once a month.  Give cats Revolution applied to skin once a month.<br /><br />On Amazon, buy Nitenpyram ($1 per tab) from Little City Dogs, which is generic for Capstar ($6 per tab).  This works for 24 hrs only and kills fleas instantly. Give animals orally (2 sizes) at the same time you are spraying house so all fleas die that day!  You can give them Nitenpyram same time as other flea meds, no problem.  Give animals another dose next day then after one week, so you keep zapping new hatchlings.<br /><br />This should eliminate fleas for 6 months till the next spraying.  I spray 2 times per year and keep my animals on monthly flea meds plus Nitenpyram as needed.\n",

Now, I'm not so dumb as to think I could use these inside the house, but I thought inside the garage might work. The bait when mixed in warm water doesn't initially have much of a strong oder.<br />I put a trap in the garage and had no catches within a couple of hours, even though the garage was buzzing with critters. I then moved the trap outside, about 20 feet from the open door. That day I had several flys trapped. The next day I had even more. The trapping accelerated each day until on about day five I had a layer of 1+ inch of dead flys in the trap jar. Unfortunately, the stench of rotting flesh was now detectable at about 50 yards away, downwind. It appears that the bait is only to get the trapping started, and it's the dead flys that really draw more flys in. At this point I had to get rid of the stench; I could either bury the god-awful mess, or pour it into the sewer system (my choice). I then employed two traps with the same smelly results. I again used the two traps but started with left-over canned cat food (in water) as the bait. The cat food seemed to do as good as the purchased bait, and the end results were again the same.<br />After thinking it over, the removal of several dozens of outside flys that are immediately replaced from the countless numbers existing in the environment is hardly worth the trouble (and smell) of using the fly traps.\n",

      "It was clumsy to  use, very smelly and did not work well. I ended up throwing it  away as it was no longer catching any flies after only a few weeks. It was promised to last for three months but it quit catching flies after only two or three weeks.<br /><br />The older Victor fly traps worked much better but are now unobtainable. They had a black screw on cap with a bright yellow dome shaped cover and a little black fly that perched on top and held it together. For the bottom they used a quart mason jar which was easy to fill. They were also easier to empty and start over when they did begin to smell. I wish that someone would manufacture them again.\n",

      "This is meant to be reusable but after staying outside last summer the plastic just became flimsy. What this means is I couldn't get the lid on it at all this year, it buckled and bent and ended up with a couple holes from the bending. Of course getting the lid on was a nasty struggle before once it's filled, the bait filled water will splash and I don't particularly like the idea of bacteria spores hatching on my hands. If the lid screwed on all this could be averted. It didn't come with a rain guard either.<br /><br />The bait itself works like a charm, can't complain about that. I think I might make my own container and just buy bait.\n",

If taking a Wilton coure, they try to sell you their entire catalog of products, which would explain why this is recommended for the class. It tastes like Crisco-y vanilla. I'd be embarrassed to use this on a cake or cupcakes that I am serving to people. It's really not a pleasant taste.<br /><br />If you do want to buy this for a Wilton course or another reason, buy it at Michaels, AC Moore, or a local baking supply store. I love Amazon--really, I do. But this is listed at nearly $9.00 here. At Michaels it's less than $4.00 (use a coupon and it's a little more than half that). At a local baking supply store, it was $3.29 plus tax.

      "One of the favorite places that I frequent when we can afford a nice meal is the The Pungent Moon in Trenton. Besides their steaks and macadamia-encrusted tilapia, one of the best things about the place is the heavenly coffee they serve with their fine desserts. The coffee is actually one of the main reasons we go.<br /><br />But one night we were there enjoying a meal and we asked for coffee with dessert and we got served this rancid stuff. I almost spit out my first sip all over the table and had to run to the bathroom because I was gagging. I made it back to the table (barely) and asked the waiter what in the wide world of sports happened to the coffee.<br /><br />He said that they were filming a television commercial for Folger's and they were secretly replacing their coffee with Folger's to film people's reactions to the coffee switch. Needless to say I didn't get to be in the commercial. It wouldn't have been very savvy marketing for Folger's to show some guy gagging and making a beeline for the bathroom after tasting their coffee.<br /><br />I don't know where they got those people in the commercials to rave about the coffee because there wasn't anyone in the restaurant doing it. Most people didn't have my reaction but a lot of them were making faces like they'd just smelled a dead octopus. It was a dirty trick. You'd think Folger's would have bagged this idea for a commercial seeing people's reactions but I guess they found some schmo to say he liked it. Someone wanting to be on TV, go figure.\n",

      "This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it \"healthy,\" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.\n",

      "I was given a sample by my vet and my cats LOVED the stuff. I immediately saw that the amount they ate of this food was much more than their usual grain-free food, they seemed to be starving and feeding all the time. They also became less energized than usual, my cats are Siamese and are constantly running after each other and very active with their toys. They became lethargic and were not as interested in their usual activities. I called my vet and she suggested catnip and not to worry, hmm, never needed catnip before...<br /><br />Well I did worry, and did my research. Online I found that Science Diet's pride and joy is their belief in using corn and other grains, you also need a chemistry major in order to fully understand their ingredient list. Last time I checked my cats were obligate carnivores and was distressed that such a food was suggested, no less by my vet. Further research I found that the reason Science Diet is so recommended by vets is because Science Diet spends quite a bit of money in the major vet schools in the nation. They also give an incredible amount of money and support to many animal hospitals and shelters, for that I commend them much! I will give credit when credit is due, I think is wonderful that they give so much charity. With that said this food is nothing more than kibble, I can see why my cats were so hungry all the time, this food did not provide the energy they required. Going back to grain-fee, the first ingredients in this product are rice and corn.<br /><br />Also the fact that this food is so expensive when is no different that the kibble in supermarket stores is ludicrous!\n",

SAWDUST is not what I want to feed my cat, even to help her lose weight.<br /><br />No wonder this food feels so \"light\" physically.  The color is lighter, and it is less dense than normal food because it's truly just fillers.<br /><br />I give it a second extra star because my cat would willingly eat this food and didn't seem to mind a whole lot, but I switched her (50/50 at first) to Blue Buffalo, which has real food ingredients and which she actually does prefer.\n",

      "I think the ingredients in this food speak for themselves - cheap filler & byproducts supplemented with vitamins.  After doing a tiny amount of research on cat nutrition I was absolutely disgusted with myself for feeding this food to my cat for over 3 years.  I am also disgusted that so many veterinarians have apparently been bought off by the Hill's company.<br /><br />This Science Diet formula's first 8 ingredients:<br />1 - Brewers rice: Filler. Processed rice product that is missing many of the nutrients contained in whole ground rice. (Cat's don't need grain, and this is the first ingredient!)<br />2 - Chicken By Product Meal: Parts of chicken not fit for human consumption, i.e. head, feet, bones, entrails, blood, intestines, etc.<br />3 - Corn Gluten Meal: Corn byproduct used as an inexpensive protein source.  Many cats and dogs are allergic to corn and, again, cats are carnivores and do not need grain.<br />4 - Powdered Cellulose:  Sawdust!<br />5 - Ground Whole Grain Corn:  More cheap, HYPER allergenic grain that cats don't need.<br />6 - Chicken Liver Flavor:  Self explanatory, but why not just use real chicken liver?<br />7 - Animal Fat: Fat from an unnamed animal source, most likely fat from many types of animals that the Hills company would rather not name.<br />8 - Soybean Mill Run: Soybean hulls - a cheap, byproduct filler.  Soy is also highly allergenic.<br /><br />The funny thing - anyone who buys Science Diet knows it's pretty expensive food.  Yet we can all reasonably presume that these fillers and byproducts probably aren't that expensive to source.  What's worse is that this food can cause serious health problems like diabetes due to the ridiculously high amount of carbohydrates (aka sugars).  The guaranteed analysis on the Hill's website indicates this food is composed of 43.2% carbohydrates.  That's completely inappropriate for the nutritional needs of cats.<br /><br />I was lucky to \"see the light\" before my cat developed any serious health problems from this food.  My cats symptoms on Science Diet were fairly mild, but still concerning - she got fatter and fatter, she was inactive, her coat was dull, and she pooped a lot.  The first food I switched her to was Taste of the Wild Rocky Mountain Formula, which is a grain-free, high protein diet that costs about half the price of Science Diet.  The first 8 ingredients of Taste of the Wild are chicken meal, peas, sweet potatoes, chicken fat, pea protein, potato protein, roasted venison, smoked salmon.  Obvious improvement over Science Diet's ingredients.  My cat loved it, started losing weight, more activity, coat became shiner, and there were litter box benefits as well (less poo because she was no longer eating filler that her body couldn't process).  I absolutely feel Taste of the Wild is an amazing value for grain-free cat food and a vastly superior product compared to Science Diet and most other commercial cat foods.<br /><br />A few months ago I found Orijen cat food and decided to switch again.  The first 8 ingredients of Orijen are fresh boneless chicken, chicken meal, fresh boneless salmon, turkey meal, fresh chicken liver, herring meal, russet potato, chicken fat.  Now doesn't the Orijen ingredient list make the Science Diet ingredients above even more laughable and sad?  After feeding Orijen and a bit of high-quality canned food every day (Tiki Cat or Nature's Variety Instict), my 4 year old cat has practically become a kitten again.  She plays every day and is the picture of lean, bright-eyed, happy feline health.  Changing my cat's diet from Science Diet to a diet appropriate for felines has completely transformed my cat in less than 6 months!<br /><br />There is so much information about feline health out there and so many holistic foods to choose from now.  I strongly believe that anyone who currently feeds Science Diet would feel immediately compelled to switch foods after doing 20-30 minutes of research.  Please do.\n",

      "My kitten--now a hefty 11 pound slug--went through the same antics as the 1-star review written about Bean.<br /><br />I couldn't figure out why our Tiki was always hungry.  Why she got fat and lazy and was always panting, but never too satiated to turn up her nose at Science Diet.  She was always begging for it, every 4 hours.  And her litter-box smells, and the size of the poos--I swear, they were human-size!  I thought okay, she's a growing kitten, she must know more than I do about her nutritional needs, so I kept filling the bowl.  But she got so huge so fast that I knew something was wrong.<br /><br />So I did my research and learned all about sub-standard pet food, and what cats really need. It's not Science Diet, that's for sure!  Yet our local pound where I adopted Tiki insisted on keeping her on Science Diet, because \"it's good for the cats and they love it\". Hmmm.<br /><br />I began weaning our Tiki off Science Diet about 2 months ago.  It has been a long and tortuous change for both of us.  I have to put up with pitiful meowing all hours of the night.  Unfortunately I have to keep a small bag of Science Diet in the pantry (long story short: our other emaciated cat Tonga needs to have a small amount of Science Diet mixed in with her good Evo food to \"fatten her up\" with empty calories).<br /><br />You should see Tiki when she comes anywhere near the Science Diet bag of food.  She goes nuts, literally.  She yanks at the bag, tries to rip it open, drags it around the house in her teeth...one time she even bit through some plastic water bottles to try to get behind them and attack the Science Diet.<br /><br />When we began this process 2 months ago I switched to Innova Evo (timed feeding) along with various expensive wet foods, freely fed.  Evo is great for the cats (though Tonga, already a sleek looking cheetah-wannabee) lost weight on it; hence, the need to augment her food with fattening, empty-cal Science Diet.  On strictly Evo and wet food  our Tiki, too, has lost weight, but it has been gradual, as I can't do it too fast, because she is still a growing kitten at 10 months.<br /><br />Sorry for the jumble of writing, but you get the point: NO to Science Diet.\n",

But in all honesty, this product has what is quite certainly the worst snap-lock reseal that I have ever encountered.

It is no better for your pet to live on stale, oxidized food than it would be for you. Oxidized fats are also called rancid.

      "I believe that people need to be aware of the fact that the kibble size of the Adult Oral Care Dry Cat Food is VERY large and presents a potential choking hazard to their pets.  I transitioned my cat to this food from the Science Diet kitten formula when he was about 15 months old.  From day one, I thought that the kibble size was abnormally large for cat food.  I've had cats for over twenty years, and have used many different cat food formulas.  Never have I seen one with kibble this large.  It is close to marble sized.  It was so large that my cat would take one piece out of his bowl at a time to eat it.<br /><br />Even though I was concerned, I was naive enough to think that Hill's would not manufacture a food that could in any way harm a person's pet as Science Diet is highly recommended by many vets.  I was terribly wrong.  About a month after transitioning to this formula, I watched in horror as my beautiful little oriental shorthair stood choking after a piece of kibble got stuck in his mouth.  For anyone who has ever witnessed this, it is a horrible sight.  The poor little cat will pant and paw at the side of their face - as if they want to reach their paw into their mouth, but can't.  I was extremely fortunate - as my boy was finally able to expel the piece of kibble from his mouth, which of course came out whole. I immediately threw the remainder of the food in the trash can.  As painful as it was to watch, I considered it a warning.  Had I not been home to witness the scene, it could have easily happened again with far more dire consequences.<br /><br />I subsequently wrote to Hill's about my concern that this food presented a choking risk and received the most ridiculous and uncaring response that you can possibly imagine.  First they felt compelled to tell me that this particular formula was designed to maintain oral care and that they had a different formula for adult cats.  This was completely insulting as I was very much aware of that fact and had intentionally purchased the food for the stated oral care benefits.  In addition, the fact that they have other formulas has nothing to do with the concern I have with this particular formula.  Next they asked if I \"transitioned\" my cat to the new food, in what I can only interpret as a lame attempt at trying to make me feel as if I was somehow responsible for the situation.  Short of putting the food into a blender, there would be no other appropriate way of \"transitioning\" one's pet to avoid the risk of choking on this product.<br /><br />I don't for one minute believe that my cat's experience was an isolated occurence.  If you are thinking about buying this product, please, please, please be aware of the risk as it is VERY real.\n",

Lids that I have seen at the pet store and elsewhere fit the smaller cans, but not the slightly larger ones.  Anyway, these Petmate lids did fit both size 3 oz. cans, along with two sizes of larger cans. HOWEVER, the plastic is so stiff and hard that they are next to impossible to snap on and off.  They were basically unusable and I threw them away.<br /><br />I also ordered another brand of lids (OurPets) for small cans and they are a dream.

      "I ordered this for my 15-lb Jack Russell. We got the stegosaurus toy and so far, it's held up. She's a ferocious chewer--we can't buy her anything but Nylabone-type toys or they immediately get torn to bits. The only problem I foresee is that the stegosaurus has four legs sticking off of the body, and I know those are going to get worn down very quickly as she can fit that whole part in her mouth at once, meaning she can't play with this unless we're there to see her least she chew off a leg and choke on it. It would've been nice to be able to have seen this variety and choose which one we wanted prior to ordering. I was thinking we would get the T-Rex pictured, which only has two feet that seem to be attached to the tail. The good news is, steggie doesn't have a small projectile head or tail, but rather it curves to give the impression of head and tail, so no worries about small pieces coming off there. The toy itself I would probably give 3.5 or 4 stars, but I am only giving it an overall 3 because the ordering process is inflexible.<br /><br />UPDATE: I have lowered my rating to 2 stars. She has had this less than 5 months and I had to take it away from her after she managed to chew away the legs, tail, head, and half the body. I don't mind if she ingests tiny shreds of a Nylabone on occasion, but I can't imagine eating 4 ounces of plastic is doing anyone's digestive tract any favors.\n",

      "This item was cute, but had absolutely no appeal to the 2 five month old Labs I have. They picked it up once and that was it. Basically, money wasted!<br />The company offered to take them back, but the postage would cost about the same as the item, so I declined.<br />Note: I've purchased several of the Nylabone products (toys to bones, etc.) for my pups, from 10 weeks old to their current 7 months, they have yet to use any of them at all.<br />Might work for some, but I ended up giving them all to the humane society.\n",

      "Bought this because it said durable and my dog uses other nylabones and I've had luck with them lasting me a short while. This wasn't the case she had the head and tail chewed off before I knew it. In less than an hour it was missing both ends. I'll have to go back to the wishbone because she takes longer to wear those down. Keep in mine my dog is a very strong chewer she can destroy things quickly so if your dog isn't a hard core chewer it might be ok for you but otherwise try something without small ends.<br /><br />EDIT- Just got worse had to call the vet due to bloody stool and this is the only thing I can think of that caused it\n",

      "My dog loved chewing on this dinosaur toy but after a couple of months he managed to finely shred it to the point that about 20% of it was missing/ingested. It didn't seem to cause any digestive problems but was disconcerting nonetheless.

      "We purchased the Stegosaurus at a local pet store the day we adopted our cattle dog mix. At the time she was about 45 pounds and 8 months old. We did not know what kind of chewer she was, but felt that a product designed for \"powerful\" chewers up to 50 pounds would be a safe choice. It was not. She worked to remove the head and tail of the dino and while we were able to get the larger pieces from her, she swallowed several very small pieces. And much to our embarrassment, at her first vet visit (3 days after adoption) we were told to stop giving her whatever \"white plastic\" toy she was chewing and eating. Enough pieces had gotten into and through her system to cause the vet concern she may not pass all of them.<br /><br />I am giving this product 1 star because:<br />1) It is described as a product for powerful chewers - it did not hold up<br />2) It is rated for dogs up to 50 pounds - while on the upper end of the scale, our dog fits into that category and the product did not hold up<br />3) the vet warned us to stop using the product as the size and shape of the pieces were potentially harmful to our dog.\n",

      "I wanted a Christmas gift my Pit Bull Terrier would love, so I got this dinosaur, something different from the regular bones. Long story short, we opened it on Saturday for Christmas, she chewed on it for a half an hour and started whining and excessively drooling. I looked in her mouth and saw she had fractured a canine tooth. My dog was in excruciating pain for two days because of the stupid shape of this bone. She was chewing on it's tail, and it literally broke a slab of her tooth off. The whole tooth had to be removed, costing me $300, and a day off work to get it fixed, not to mention all the pain and anxiety my dog went through. JUST STAY AWAY FROM THIS ONE!<br /><br />I've been giving my pitty the Nylabone brand chews since she was little. We've tried the Big Chews, Regular and Wolf size, and even the smaller ones and have never had a problem before this one. She loves the liver and bacon flavors, but I've been hesitant to give her any of these bones since our incident. She loves them though, and they keep her teeth clean.\n",

First we saw pieces about the size of 1/4 a rice in her feces.  Then I found her with a piece about the size of a dime in her mouth.  It was irregular and did not look like something that would pass easily.<br />We chucked the white ones and now I'm trying to find the good ones.<br />Not so easy since websites show pictures of both so I'm not certain what we'd get.<br /><br />I would never give my dog these white Nylabones.<br /><br />I did not buy Nylabones here.

I guess it's a common occurrence judging by other reviewers on here.  And my vet also said he's had 8 dogs come in with the same problem in the last 2 years, all with Nylabone dental chew toys.<br />Had to get dental work done on my baby and her teeth were extracted.

They stayed on the floor for them to enjoy at anytime, but they rarely have. And when they did chew them - well, I had small hard white pieces all over my rug.

      "My dog was on Canidae for almost 2 years and she loved it.  She was healthy with a full, shiny coat and plenty of energy.  Then suddenly around December she started vomiting and having loose yellow stools, and became very lethargic.  We took her to 2 vets and after several hundred dollars in tests they couldn't find anything wrong with her.<br /><br />I did some research and found that there were numerous people having the exact same problems I was!  It turns out, they recently changed their formula, changed manufacturers, and decreased the amount of food in their package.  Do some research, it's not the same high-quality food it used to be!\n",
      "2251\n",
      "We fed Canidae to our two dogs for almost 5 years--they always ate it eagerly, never had stomach upset, and got raves from the vet for their muscle, weight, and coats.  It *was* a 5-star food.  But last summer we opened a fresh bag of kibble (same exact packaging bought from our usual store) and immediately noticed it was much lighter in color than previous bags, but we fed it anyway. Within a day our Aussie, who has a bulletproof stomach with absolutely no digestive issues, began to have horrible gas, softer stools, and really loud, liquidy gurgling noises in his abdomen.  We continued to feed the entire bag, thinking that he'd adjust to it eventually because our other dog was fine.  Well, our Aussie never did adjust to it; he spent a month having those symptoms, and we dreaded mealtimes because of the stench and sounds he'd create.<br /><br />The kibble in the next bag we bought was the old normal shade of brown, and our Aussie's stomach noises, soft stools, and awful gas went away practically overnight. But by then I was hearing and reading that Canidae had developed a new formula that was making dogs sick. The stories about people whose dogs got *far* sicker than ours, and the dodgy responses that those long-time customers got from Canidae when they called to complain about the unannounced change, made us decide it was time for a new dog food.  We went with Healthwise, a premium kibble made by the same company that makes Innova, California Natural, and Evo.  It's not worth it to continue to be loyal to Canidae and to risk our dogs perhaps getting as sick as many others have.  Read Canidae's new formula horror stories at consumeraffairs.com.\n",

      "We adopted Penelope, a 6 mo. old min pin hound mix, a couple weeks ago. We decided to switch her from Purina Pro Plan w/ Shredded Chicken to a premium food. After reading many conflicting reviews on this site and elsewhere, we decided to try Canidae. My sister feeds Canidae with great results and, at our local pet store, it is the cheapest of the premium foods by a narrow margin.<br /><br />We mixed only a little Canidae into Penny's kibble. My guess is about 6-8 pieces or 1/12 of her total breakfast/dinner. We watched her very closely. Within a day, we noticed some changes. First of all, she lost a little focus in training, seeming a bit more confused than usual. No biggie. She also sneezed a few times (she has never sneezed before). More importantly, though, we noticed that she started to nibble and chew on her feet. This continued sporadically for another day and half. It wasn't constant or serious. She didn't seem agitated and she didn't bite her feet to the point of redness or bleeding. Still, it was VERY clear that this was caused by the change in diet (nothing else in her routine changed) and this was only with 12-16 pieces of Canidae per day. Having read the reviews of Canidae's new formula, we had known that this might happen. We made the decision to switch right away.<br /><br />After a lot of research, we decided to try Solid Gold Hund-N-Flocken for Puppies. We mixed in the Solid Gold at the same proportions as the Canidae. The nibbling stopped immediately. No sneezing, either. Her focus seems to have improved as well, though I can't completely credit that to the food because puppies have on and off days. Still, it is clear that the more serious allergy problems have been resolved.<br /><br />If you've done any research on dog foods at all, you already know that finding the right food requires you to go beyond the ingredient list. Some foods just don't work with some dogs, however good they look on paper. Indeed, I am convinced after many hours of reading reviews that NO food works for ALL dogs. That said, it is clear that many, many more people have had problems with the new Canidae formula than they have with other premium or super-premium brands. Who knows why (Canidae claims the new formula has no changes that could account for allergies), and who cares? Feel free to try Canidae for your dog, but watch him or her very closely. Or, better yet, do what I wish I did, and just start with a different brand. There is nothing special about the Canidae ingredients list, so why risk it?\n",

      "I fed Canidae ALS (old formula) for 7+ years and my dogs thrived.  Canidae switched their formula (and mfg) and I immediately switched to another food afer the reported of problems.  My feed store talked me into trying their 'new' formula, and I went back to ALS - BIG mistake.  I have experienced 15-20+% weight loss, explosive diarreha, vomitting, lethargy. etc.  I have 5 dogs - 60-100+ lbs, varying pedigrees, ages 1 to 12+ - all sick (15-20% weight loss, poor coats, vomitting, etc.).  I have had to run complete extensive blood panels to rule out other health problems on all the dogs - bottomline - blood panels were OK, food (Canidae) was the issue.  What use to be a fantastic food is now a very dangerous food to feed.  An entire pack of dogs' health declined on the 'new' formula.  I switched foods (something other than Canidae) and my dogs are now recovering.  If you love Las Vegas and Russian Roulette feed Canidae - if want to avoid major Vet expenses and heartache choose another food.  Do your homework - research the Canidae ALS problems - then make the best 'educated' decision for you and your pets.<br />----<br />It's been a over a year since I originally posted review of this product, and I thought it was time for an update.<br /><br />I still warn folks from feeding Canidae ALS...other Canidae formuals I don't know.  My dogs have recovered (thank goodness).  They are back to running the fenceline, greeting visitors, etc. - and not as sickly as they had become - aka the lethergic, diarreha, lost weight crew I was faced with.<br /><br />I know there are a bunch of pros and cons out there on various websites concerning Canidae - and I use to be one of the biggest 'flag wavers' for Canidae....until the formula change and the Vet expenses I was forced to face.  Believe me - with a very heavy heart I cannot recommend Canidae any more.  I do not do this with a flare of being noticed on the Internet, any vindications against the company, or any personnal gain...just a great concern for the illnesses I've experienced with my 'pack' (5+ dogs).  It took several months (under Vet care & dry dog food changes) for my dogs to recover, and I don't want to see any other 'beloved family members' undergo what I've/we've gone through.  Please, please, PLEASE check out [...] (a highly recommended (non-bias)dog food analysis site).  They are still recommending Canidae ALS as a 5-Star (6 star being the highest rating) premium food to feed - with the caveate 'However, from a position of being a product about which DFA heard very few complaints, the number of animals we hear of that do not do well on this food appears to have risen substantially.'<br /><br />All I ask is do your own personal research concerning this food, keep an eye on your pet's food reactions, and make the best 'educated' decision for your beloved 'four footed/furry' family members.\n",

      "When i first opened the box it looked perfectly fine. the expiration date was april 2012 the bag seemed fine. That is until i went to open the corner. The resealable pouring spout was already opened. The seal is supposed to be intact until it is opened for the first time. To me it looks as if someone had reused this bag. Im not entirely sure if it is even the same dog food. Someone could have just put in what ever they feel like and called it \"Canidae\" and charged me $55.00. The dog food looked different as well. it had the same texture but the pieces were all bigger and a darker color. I had a bag of canidae that i had from before so i compared them! I will not be feeding this to my dog. I guess lesson learned from buying on the internet. maybe my story will make you think twice. on the bright side the price was cheaper and the shipping to hawaii for me was less than a week! free shipping i may add! So buy at your own risk! My dogs health isnt worth taking a chance that it could be canidae in there! I want to be certain that it is 100 % canidae!!<br /><br />-Phillip\n",

A week and a half later, I was feeding approx half old and half new, and one of the dogs started vomiting/had diarrhea, had no appetite, and was lethargic.  I'm switching him to a plain chicken and rice diet, but if he doesn't get better soon, I'll have to take him to the vet.<br /><br />Other dog must have an iron constitution because she seems fine.<br /><br />UPDATE:  Took the sick dog to the vet.  He was given IV fluids because he became dehydrated.  $150 and one day later, he seems a little better.  But vet said the blood work came back a little off and I should bring him back for x-ray and recheck.  I'm going to hold off because I do think he's improving on the bland diet.<br /><br />The other dog had some alarming sounds coming from her stomach last night.

I found that hard to believe, but we couldn't find anything else wrong. If you read the complaints you will see many people have lost their dogs. They started using one of the very companies for production whose imported food killed so many animals a year or so ago.<br /><br />As soon as I quit feeding him this poison, he started getting better. I was one of the lucky ones since my pet did not die, but as I write this, he still has not gained all his weight back.<br /><br />The company is acting as if nothing is wrong.

      "If I could give this product no stars I would.  We have been giving this dog food to our dogs for years.  But for the past month or so when the formula was changed and put on the shelf our dog has been having an allergic reaction to something.  At first we thought it was just allergies as dogs like humans, change as they get older.  As he was the only one to have problems.  We tried cleaning our patio on a daily basis. Bought new food and water bowls to stainless steel.  Wash the water bowl as much as possible.<br /><br />We even took him to the vet NUMEROUS times.  Our vet, which has been practicing for over 25 years and is the best in our area was puzzled when nothing worked.  Our dog started to lose his fur, has odd looking spots all over, under his chin he has open sores that do not go away no matter how much we wash and put medicine on it, and he's consistently scraching and making it worse.  In between his toes it's red and inflamed, in his ears are a bright red color like a rash.  Lastly, he hasn't been eating as much and has been having diarreah.  A week later our other dog broke out in hives and had to be rushed to the emergency room.  They gave her shots and they slowly went away.  But now she is starting to experience the same problems as our other dog.<br /><br />The last time we went down to the pet store to pick up his food we over heard other customers yelling about the food making their dog sick.  We heard all of the same symptoms as I just described above and the shop owner didn't know why and has taken the food off of the shelf, and had given them a refund.  We decided to not buy any more canidae but to go online and do some research.<br /><br />We have found out that Canidae has changed their formula and has added many new ingredients.  All of which are grains such as millet, that MOST dogs are allergic to.  We have found other forums of people describing the same issues that they're having with their dogs just like we are.  When we called customer service they did nothing and blamed us for our dogs reaction to the food.  When I asked how is it our fault for your inadequte labeling on the bag in which the food is in when we buy it?  And how is it our fault when we've been using your dog food for the last 7 years? There was no response, the \"customer service representative\" if you can call her that, simply said \"if you don't like it then don't buy it.\" And then she hung up on me.<br /><br />The bag never changed it's appearance nor did they add any \"stickers\" to indicate a change in their formula.  If there had been I would have checked to make sure that what they changed it to wouldn't affect my dogs, or at the very lest I would have known what signs to watch for and change this terrible food to something different if they had a reaction as they did.  I feel this horrible company should have to pay for my vet bills as they did not inform us the consumers of their changes.  I understand I choose to have pets, and purchase their foods, but I did not choose to change a formula that was fine just the way it was.  Could the reason for changing the formula was to make it cheaper for them to produce??  How about just increasing the price of the dog food if that was the case, because I would have kept purchasing it.  Should they see the light and go back to their old formula my family will never purchase it again just like the many others that I'm sure will not.<br /><br />I have now chosen a food for them that is GRAIN FREE and they are now starting to chow down like they once did.  We will have a long recovery road ahead for our male dog as his coat and face has it the worst.  My hope is that anyone looking to buy this food find out about what the formula has done to others animals like mine before they buy it.\n",

      "I have an otherwise healthy and active 1 year old Rottweiler.  I switched her from Blue Buffalo to Canidae, as it came highly recommended by the holistic pet store I frequent (they are going to be the next to get an earful from me!!!).<br /><br />Shortly after, I noticed her stool became loose, which is common when you change a dog's diet (I mixed the new food with the old for a week, gradually increasing the amount of the new).  I figured it would get better after a few days.  In fact, it became increasingly worse to the point where spots of blood where showing up in her stool.<br /><br />I took her to the vet thinking at this point she must have picked up a parasite.  The test came back negative.  My vet thought it must have been something she ate and recommended I feed her chicken and rice for a week to even her out.  I did this and the problem was solved.<br /><br />After a week I put her back on her regular food- Canidae- and the problem she was having before began to return, albeit gradually.  We have now started to see spots of blood again.  This convinced me it was not just \"something she picked up,\" but the dog food itself.<br /><br />Now I have learned there is actually a CLASS ACTION SUIT against this dog food maker for the exact problem I described- in some cases people's dogs even died.

      "My dogs have been on Canidae for the past several years and even the picky dog who has lost over half her teeth loved it.  However, I recently bought a new bag of Canidae.  The packaging was different, but I thought that was the only thing that had changed because there was nothing on the bag indicating it was a new formula.<br /><br />I noticed the kibble was a lighter color than in previous bags, but still didn't think much of it. However, two out of my three dogs now consistently refuse to eat it.  The only dog who will eat this new bag is the one who has been on a diet for two years and quite frankly, will eat anything.<br /><br />I'm very disappointed that the change in the formula was not even mentioned on the bag and that they changed a great food into one that my dogs won't eat.<br /><br />NOTE: I emailed Canidae to ask why the formula had changed, and why it was not mentioned on the new bags.  Their response:<br /><br />*********<br />Our quality of raw material as well as quality control has actually increased not decreased. Yes we have diversified our complex carbohydrates as rice continues to climb and high quality availability decreases. Our products are better than ever and more consistent. We are getting a lot of positive feedback from our customers that are actually feeding their pets our improved formulas.<br />*********<br /><br />I hadn't actually said I thought their raw material decreased...just that 2 of my 3 dogs now refused to eat it.  And when they say they are getting positive feedback from our customers that are *actually* feeding the new formula, are they trying to imply that I only pretended to feed the new food?!?!\n",

      "I have ONLY fed my 3 dogs Canidae since 2002. Until 3 days ago we have HAD no problems at all, and I had highly recommended the food to everyone who would listen. That is NO longer the case.<br /><br />Recently, Canidae decided to change the formula, and without any notice being placed on the bag.  Two weeks into the first, and LAST bag of Canidae I will every buy, one of my dogs began chewing his feet. Prior to 3 days ago, he had never had a \"hot spot\" or anything close to it.... And now I cannot get him to stop chewing his red, soaking wet paws. One expensive vet bill later, the vet said it is an \"allergic reaction.\"  Allergies??!! I do not want my dogs to be miserable with allergies!!<br /><br />Besides the constant chewing, not one of my dogs has had a firm stool since their first meal with the new formula. One of my dogs is prone to anal glad issues, and so it is critical that she have a firm stool.<br /><br />In addition to my issues, my breeder, who recommended the food to me, and who has been feeding her dogs Canidae for much longer than I, has taken her dogs off the food. Why? Her dogs became violently ill, vomiting non-stop, itching, acting lethargic. She has contacted the MANY, MANY people she knows who use Canidae, and they have all had issues, many have taken their dogs to the vet, and have all now switched to a different food... not made by Canidae.<br /><br />It's too bad they chose to make this change; they have lost countless loyal customers over trying to save money on rice. I can't imagine they will be in business much longer.<br /><br />******** UPDATED 10/2/08 : I've moved all my dogs to California Natural. My breeder has also switched her dogs to California Natural. So far everyone is doing great... after the Canidae got out of their systems.\n",

      "My Black Lab has been eating Canidae All Life Stages dry dog food since we switched her from puppy food to Canidae in early 2006.  Our breeder recommended this dog food.  She did well on the old formula, except for what we THOUGHT were seasonal hot spots where she would chew the hair off of the insides of her legs and also her behind.<br /><br />Since purchasing my latest bag about three weeks ago she has been throwing up, having frequent burping which smells of vomit, having horribly smelly flatulance, and I had to clean my carpet from a poop accident two days ago.<br /><br />I was initially just upset to find that my latest bag had been down-sized from 40 lbs. to 35 lb.  I sent an e-mail telling them that I would rather pay more for something than have it down-sized.  Their response was :<br /><br />\"Our economy and industry is faced with challenging times, commodities and energy cost are at an all time high and continue to sky rocket.\"<br /><br />They ended their response with this condescending comment :<br /><br />\"We have also had a lot of positive feedback from our women shoppers who love the new sizes as they can handle them much better when unloading them from their car.\"<br /><br />After talking with my dog's breeder, I discovered that the formula had been changed and that her dogs and many other breeders' dogs had been having problems with the new formula.  The \"Canidae Team\" didn't mention the formula change when I asked them about the down-sizing.  That would have been nice.<br /><br />So, I started searching the internet and found more horror stories of dogs becoming sick with the new formula.  Plus, many dog owners were upset that Canidae did not make much of an effort to inform their customers of the new formula change.<br /><br />I sent another e-mail to Canidae regarding the formula change, their lack of informing their customers about it, and how my dog has been reacting to it.  They didn't address my comments about how it was making my dog and others sick, they just stated that they did their best to post their changes on the internet.  From what I have been reading in posts, that is not the case.  I also found out through forum postings on the internet that Canidae is now in partnership with Diamond Pet Foods.  Diamond was involved in the dog food recalls where dogs were dying from the tainted food.  Maybe since the recall and deaths, Diamond has cleaned up their act and has more stringent guidelines and inspections but who wants to take that chance when it comes to our beloved dogs?\n",

      "I have a cat who had serious intestinal issues. I needed a canned food that was grain free and also I need a protein that was not chicken - I had to start my cat on a novel protein. I bought this on the recommendation of a veterinarian (L. Pierson) on her web site, for so called \"acceptable\" canned food, because it is grain free. However if you read the ingredients list, it contains other ingredients that the same veterinarian says are allergenic to cats (e.g. carageenan). Also, even though its name claims it is \"Turkey\", (the turkey was supposed to be the novel protein for me) the ingredients list lists chicken and chicken parts as its 2nd, 3rd and 4th ingredients. It also has the same type of thickeners, fillers, and \"flavoring\" that all the other run of the mill canned pet food has.<br /><br />I originally gave this a 3 star rating (because it doesn't contain grains), but as I typed my review I was reminded of the deception and it made me change it to a 2 star.\n",

      "...lousy packaging/storage.  While the food itself is wonderful and the cat loves it, Amazon really made a mess of my order.  When the cans were opened, the contents had separated into solid and liquid.  We tried to mix it together again, but the cat refused it.  I email the company and sent a picture along and they said it had been subjected to extreme heat and had cooked in the can.  It wasn't hot locally, so I believe it happened while in Amazon's hands.  Additionally, Amazon has been less then helpful in processing the return.<br /><br />So, buy the food for your cat if it likes it, but just not from Amazon.  Get it from a company that handles food products regularly; they probably know a lot more about keeping products edible.\n",

      "Holy Mother of God.<br /><br />I experienced this affront to all five senses via my girlfriend, who had, admirably, attempted to use an enviro-friendly product to collect her cat's bodily excretions. While it may or may not be friendly to the outdoors, it fails horrifically as a cat litter.<br /><br />1. Clumping. If, by \"clumping,\" you mean \"forms a heavy, dough-like glutenous paste,\" you have found your litter. The back of the box, where Calvin piddles, was instantly and constantly filled with a reeking, lava like mudslide, of such dense and sticky consistency that it was nearly impenetrable to a standard scoop, and clung tenaciously to the wall of the box. It was like making a modeling clay from heavy sand, flour, and corn syrup. Two scoops valiantly gave their lives trying to pry this nightmare from it's perch.<br /><br />2. Odor. Now, let's establish something. I have a high tolerance for messes. I've worked in food service, hauling Summer-ripened bags of trash, half food waste, half cashew-sized maggots, dribbling their secretions across the floor, me, and anyone unfortunate enough to get near, for a period of years. Not my fondest memories, but I dealt, heck, I got a kick laughing at my fellow employees if their constitution prevented them from lending a hand.<br /><br />That said, this product generates a hellish stench. The box was scooped daily, or nearly so. I have no idea how the cat stayed in their long enough to commit his excretory functions. The smell of urine and ammonia battered my nose like a pro boxer built from pee. Of course, given the sludgy consistency (see #1), I was doomed to enjoy this assault for several minutes at an eye-watering stretch.<br /><br />The pee smell, however, was only the tip of the stinky iceberg.<br /><br />Ever gotten sick from over-eating, or maybe a plate of food gone bad? Say, for example, lobster. Dinner's over, you're thinking \"mmm, tasty, butter-soaked, sweet lobster meat,\" when suddenly, your entire digestive tract is pummeled by several MMA expert bacteria strains, and you spend four hours in the bathroom, as your stomach competes with your large intestine in a race to wring out to total vacancy. The worst part: the overwhelming taste and smell of the digestive-fluid washed tainted lobster is clearly identifiable as your original meal, the sweet, greasy meat now blended with bile and the overwhelming aroma of your failing bowel. That will be the last lobster you order for a decade or two. This isn't a derail, there's a point upcoming:<br /><br />2(a). The odor. Just the stench of urine fertilized by wheat byproducts would be unbearable, but the olfactory insult to injury is that this is, in fact, wheat. You know, the stuff they make bread, noodles, pizza and so on from. The smell of raw, warm dough is comprehensively integral with the overall stench of this ghastly substance. Imagine for a moment, you came across a bread recipe: 2 cups flour, 1tsp sugar, 1 package of yeast, and 1 cup of warm cat urine. Mix well, and place in a warm oven to rise. Now, hover your head 10\" over the bowl, while you exert yourself mightily trying to pry a silicon putty-like mass from the wall of a litter box without shattering your last litter scoop, your elevated respiration drawing the deadly waft of rancid bread into the base of your lungs with each gagging gasp. Good times.<br /><br />3. Everything else. It's absorbency is poor. A side effect of the piss-poor clumping is that the liquid waste spreads around, tying up a massive amount of litter. Price. Yay! It cost far more than regular litter to begin with, and you toss out half the box every day? Where do I sign? Dust. Fortunately, after scarring your sinuses with yeasty ammonia, powdered chaff is almost pleasant. Tracking. No advantage over regular litter.<br /><br />Avoid this trash, you are better off not keeping a box, and let your pets do what they will. It will take less time to clean the mess than the box, the smell won't be as bad, and you won't have to quit eating bread.<br /><br />I award you no points, and may God have mercy on your soul.\n",

      "I have used World's Greatest Litter for a couple years, and saw this on the shelves.  So I decided to try it.  Here was the result:<br /><br />1.  Swheat Scoop is cheaper than World's Greatest<br /><br />2.  Swheat Scoop is more fun to say.<br /><br />3.  Swheat Scoop is less dusty than World's Greatest<br /><br />Now for the bad part:<br /><br />1.  I am very allergic to the dust Swheat Scoop causes<br /><br />2.  The clumping sticks like glue to the bottom of the box, no matter how deep I filled it.<br /><br />3.  The instructions on how to use it were in the bottom of the bag, which didn't halp until I'd already used most of it.<br /><br />4.  The litter tracks much worse than World's Greatest, since the clumps are harder, they stick between paws easier, and are transported to all areas of the house.<br /><br />5.  The litter is harder, so when you step on a tiny clump with bare feet, it hurts more.  Only thing more painful is Litter Pearls.<br /><br />So overall, I am not impressed.  Your mileage may vary.\n",

      "I've been using SWheat Scoop for almost year and thought great product..until I started noticing tiny black bugs infesting flooring around the litter box. Took a while to realize bugs connected to the Swheat Scoop. I tried removing the BOX and keeping litter in air tight container but found More Bugs.  So I examined the litter and its well, Littered w/ tiny BUGS. This isn't one box..its several months of boxes.<br /><br />I am alerting the pet store but likely the Litter is infected. You wouldn't notice these bugs unless sweep them onto white background. Gross...switching litter immediately (have no idea to what). good luck.\n",

      "I had used this litter on and off for a couple years without any real problems, like a lot of other reviewers. But - like several others - I have had insects come out of a box I have purchased. They are very small, white, and look like dust. But when you look closely, you see that the dust is moving and is actually alive! I first noticed them on the edges of one of the litter pans, so I dumped the litter and bleached the pan. I didn't suspect the insects were coming from the litter itself, so I refilled the pan with the Swheat Scoop. After a day or so, the bugs had spread to the other litter pans, and then I saw that they had spread to the floor because they were on the litter that the cats had kicked out onto the ground. They even spread to detergent bottles that had been set on the floor and were on the trash can and in the vacuum! Bleach, insecticide spray, soap...nothing worked! I had to hire a professional exterminator. He discovered that the source was indeed the Swheat Scoop because he checked the box that I had been using and found eggs and insects inside. He said they were a type of pantry pest that was feeding on the wheat.<br /><br />So - bottom line: even though this litter was good and I liked it, all the stress and money I had to spend because of one insect-infested box (and the GROSS factor) is, for me, not worth taking the chance on this product again!!!\n",

      "My wife and I have used this product for some time now.  When it first came out, they claimed no dust.  Well, there was always dust, but because it was natural and scooped, we decided to keep using it.  This was a big mistake.  This litter tracks all over the house and has ruined 2 vacuum cleaners because the dust is so fine it bypasses the bag and enters / cloggs the motor mechanisms.<br /><br />We have 3 cats that all are suffering terribly from respiratory issues caused by the dust from this litter.  If you don't believe that there's dust, as some of the reviews have claimed, then just simply OPEN YOUR BLINDS on your windows, allow the sunlight to come into the room / the boxes you're scooping,  and then scoop it,  or move it around in the box.  You won't believe the huge amount of micro-fine dust that billows out of the boxes.  You can't see these \"dusts\" in standard interior light, but if the sun is bright enough shining through the window, it's amazing how far up this stuff travels.  Imagine being inside a box, scratching away @ this litter, and breathing in all that dust.  No wonder why our cats always appear sick.<br /><br />Google Swheat Litter and respiratory issues and you'll find others who've had the same problem.  I've caused my cats enough grief, and we're switching to something better.<br /><br />EDIT:<br /><br />I'm editing my review without changing anything written above, as I've read more of the other reviews posted here about how \"wonderful\" this cat litter is. I need to reiterate my thoughts, so whomever buys this product gets to make a better \"educated decison\" for themselves on how \"wonderful\" it is ...based upon factual evidence that they can create and see for themselves, and not just go by some BS review of praise.  Yeah, it clumps, and it saves money, but there's more to it than that.<br /><br />Buy a bag or box or whatever size you like of the litter.  Put it in a cat box, and let it sit for a day, hour, week.... it doesn't matter.  OPEN YOUR BLINDS ON YOUR WINDOW AND SHAKE THE BOX IN THE SUNLIGHT !  Move it around with a SCOOP !  do whatever it takes to make the stuff move around in the box, short of throwing it around.  WATCH THE DUST BILLOW UPWARDS like a cloud rising up from a fire.  You won't believe it.  These particles are so \"micro-fine\" that they lift upwards and into your face as you're scooping. Now imagine how your cat is doing, being right in there in that dust.  You can't see the dust, as it's too fine, unless you move it around in sunlight.  You'll be horrified at how much it just billows up out of the box.<br /><br />After trying this \"test\", you can now make your own decision based upon your results that you see before you.  Personally, I'm tired of constantly bringing my cats to the vet for respiratory problems.  They're indoor cats that aren't exposed anything but this litter.  Since we switched to a \"pine pellet\" type, our house has stayed clean, and our cats are back to breathing normally.  Id never use the swheatlitter again.<br /><br />Nuff said.\n",

They are an amazing company and I will always shop online with them.<br /><br />I had been feeding my older dogs Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul (Senior) for about a year. And about two weeks before the \"voluntary\" recall came out in April of 2012, my dogs were both extremely violently ill (vomiting, diarreah and no appetite that lasted a week - until I got them help). Both had to be seen by the vet and both were perscribed antibiotics. Shortly after these bouts of illness I learned about the salmonella tainted food in the South Carolina plant. Diamond Dog Food (the manufacturer of many foods including Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul) had denied that any dogs were sickened by this food but I am 2000% positive that they were. They said they would not accept responsibility unless I could prove it. But I couldn't because I didn't save any of their poop to have it tested (my vet's assessment was not enough for them to accept responsibility.) Also be aware that they were also involved in a recall back in 2005 (I think that's the year) that killed several dogs due to their neglegence. So this isn't the first time Diamond has harmed dogs. I personally will not forgive what they did to my dogs and to me. I also know that my dogs were not the only dogs sickened. They currently have a class action lawsuit against them for sickening HUMANS, but sadly there are no attorneys willing to represent animals in this matter.<br /><br />What I find even sneakier on the part of Diamond was the timing of their recall. I actually purchased the tainted food in February 2012 and didn't begin feeding it to my dogs until April because I had a previous bag of the same food that was already open. So they knew the timing of this dog food recall was well beyond anybody being able to prove their dogs were poisoned. (They also told me that once the bag was opened, I couldn't prove it was poisoned because the bag could become poisoned/contaminated through \"other\" means...meaning they would accuse me of poisining my food and my own dogs. I had a 35 lb bag of that tainted food of which maybe only 5 lbs. was eaten.) This company is SCUM. People, if it's made by Diamond...RUN don't walk in the opposite direction!!!!<br /><br />If I could give them a ZERO rating - I would...In fact I would WARN anyone who loves their animals to avoid this manufacturer once and for all.\n",

      "Meow Mix is one of the cheapest brands of cat food widely sold in supermarkets and convenient stores.  Unfortunately, it's trash; mostly low-grade corn and soy with some chicken byproduct meal and beef tallow (low grade fat) for flavoring.  It's cheap for a reason.<br /><br />My sweet cat that I just brought home from the shelter was raised by her previous owner on Meow Mix.  She sheds like crazy, which should resolve now that she's receiving real food.\n",
      "2372\n",
      "I was raised in a house that always had at least one cat being fed Meow Mix. Owning my own cat now, I've done some research on available food choices. Meow Mix is one of the cheapest--and one of the worst.<br /><br />Not quite like humans, cats will eat until they are nutritionally satisfied *or* full. The problem with cheap brand cat foods is that they use synthetic products, carbohydrate-based fillers, and processed meat by-products. Cats are obligate carnivores. The first two ingredients on Meow Mix's list (the ones used in most abundance in the product) are corn. As a result, cats are getting fewer needed nutrients per serving, causing them to eat until they get full and to eat more over the course of the day.<br /><br />Healthy food results in a healthier cat. Weight control, shedding, disease development, and more are all influenced by a cat's food. The excessive use of carbohydrate-based fillers in cheap cat foods, as part of this reality, can lead to weight gain and a higher risk of diabetes.<br /><br />Brands sold in quality pet stores start with Iambs as the \"baseline,\" and even Iambs isn't what I'd call good for your cat. Many of my local shelters feed their cats Iambs as the least expensive acceptable cat food. Even better, companies such as Orijen and EVO make premium cat foods made with very little or no grain content, which are ingredients cats would not naturally eat. Whatever you decide, check the ingredients list. Make sure some kind of meat is listed as the primary ingredient with other meats as close to the top of the list as possible. Also make sure those are actual meats. Meats are better then meat meals, and meat meals are ok (and usually unavoidable). Meat by-products are what you want to watch out for.<br /><br />The reality is that your cat is not biologically designed to eat a diet consisting mostly of corn or grain. Healthy cat food is more expensive, but your cat will eat less of it, helping to mitigate the cost a bit. I recommend premium cat foods for this reason. They're better for your cat in every conceivable way, and they won't break your bank. Even if you are on a budget, consider the cost medical concerns due to obesity or diabetes could incur. If you are currently using this food, maybe it's time to switch.\n",

      "I've had my cat for four years now, and I've almost always fed her Meow Mix because its inexpensive, and its what my family used to buy to feed her and other cats we've had in the past. Since she seemed to favor it, I continued to feed it to her after I had moved out of the house, taking her along with me. Although I'd clean up her messes before, she tends to vomit almost all the time (or maybe I just notice it more?)<br /><br />What I've come to realize that she vomits up this food at least once or twice a month. Once I did some research on cat nutrition, and then looked at the ingredients in this food, its really not what you want your cat to be eating...<br /><br />I know it'll be more expensive, but I'd rather give my cat something that she can digest and enjoy, with quality, than give her something cheap that makes her sick.\n",

      "I've been feeding my wife's kitty Meow Mix for at least a couple of years--because it's cheap and I don't care enough about the cat to spend more money on cat food.  Now, I'm annoyed enough at having to clean kitty puke that I'll spend money to make it stop.<br /><br />I'm changing my cat's food after reading that Meow Mix is mostly of corn and tends to make cats puke, often.  My cat overeats, then pukes, Meow Mix a couple of times a week.  I can minimize the puke by giving her a 1/4 cup twice a day, but we have 2 cats and the other one is very active.  Since they both have access to the same food bowl (cat door), it's inconvenient to keep the bulimic kitty away while normal kitty eats.<br /><br />A couple 20 lb. bags ago, kitty ate not-Meow Mix.  I don't recall her puking while eating that food.  Now it's time for more research.<br /><br />I'm changing cat foods when this bag runs low.  I'll also start weighing the cat food to find out how much she's eating at a time and per day.  If the puking stops with new food, I'll reintroduce meow mix and see if it returns.  I'll stop blaming Meow Mix and update this review if I find that bulimic kitty pukes with other food.<br /><br />If your kitty pukes Meow Mix, please post a review and spread the word.\n",

      "Meow Mix is in the top five worst things you can feed your cat. What should be a filler in most cheap cat foods is listed first on the ingredient list. So if corn is the main product, then cheap meat by-products are the filler? Exactly where is the nutrition?<br /><br />Also, on the vomiting thing. We used to have cats growing up, and while my mom didn't know any better, we fed them this food often. One of our cats would vomit frequently (almost every day) and I vividly remember walking through the house and stepping in large piles of red-dye vomit from her stomach rejecting this mass-marketed cardboard garbage. It would stain the carpet and we'd spend more time cleaning up rejected cat food than we did feeding it.<br /><br />Look, if your cat is vomiting, it's obviously not good for them. Most poor cat foods a cat's body will at least tolerate, but if they can't even keep it down, well, you do the math.<br /><br />Meow Mix's dry food should be taken off the market. It's unhealthy, unethical, and harmful to animals.<br /><br />If you're looking to save money, spend money on a medium-high grade of cat food. You won't spend as much on litter and your cat will get full faster. Check out <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018CLWC4\">Chicken Soup for the Cat Lover's Soul Dry Cat Food for Adult Cat</a> for starters. You can find it at most fleet stores or you can choose to order it online. It's only a couple bucks more than this garbage and it's 7x better for your cat and your cat's health. Don't put your cats through what mine went through growing up.<br /><br />If you love your cat in any way shape or form, you will avoid this food.\n",

      "Made the big mistake of buying Meow-Mix.<br /><br />Cat vomited (as all cats sometimes due) after eating Meow-Mix.  Unfortunately the cat vomited on carpet.  Usually unfortunate but no big deal - just clean it up.  WRONG!  Meow-Mix has red food dyes that will not come out - even if you start cleaning right after the event.  We have tried three different cleaners and a carpet machine.  We still have two big red/pink stains in the carpet.<br /><br />I called the MeowMix customer service number and asked for some help on how to clean their red dye out of the carpeting.  They told me to use a carpet cleaner - Really?  Wow. Insightful.<br /><br />I asked them why they put in apparently un-cleanable red dye in the cat food when they know cats are virtually color blind (for reds apparently) and when the cat pukes it is going to ruin their customers carpet.  They said market research indicated the human buyers prefer to see a red, meaty, color and their was nothing they could do about it.<br /><br />Yeah, how about not putting the red dye in or using another red dye?<br /><br />Through almost and entire 25lb bag of MeowMix out in the trash and purchased Iams which is no issue to clean up.<br /><br />Thanks for reading.  Don't buy MeowMix unless you live outdoors.\n",

      "We've been feeding this to our Great Dane and honestly it hasn't worked out too well.<br /><br />Our dog is just over a year old and at her annual vet visit the vet pointed out that she was developing a yeast infection in her ear.  He told me it was most likely from her food and asked what we feed her.  I told him we feed her IAMS Large Breed food, and he said that it was probably the problem.<br /><br />He said we didn't need to treat it at the level that it was at, but that if she got to where she was shaking her ears a lot, or pawing at them, or if we noticed other symptoms, we would want to try a better diet to see if it fixed it.<br /><br />So, our dog's ears got worse.  She was constantly shaking her ears.  Her skin developed really bad dandruff.  She used to be really obedient, but she became really naughty.  I called the vet's office and we're switching her to a wheat-free corn-free diet now.  Last week we transitioned her over and this week we have already seen a little improvement; she doesn't shake her ears much at all anymore.  We'll watch and see if the dandruff and behavior problems also go away.  I am hopeful that they will.<br /><br />Maybe some dogs can eat this and be fine--our dog LIKES eating IAMS food...but it's just really obvious that it hasn't been good for her.  Until her vet told me, I had no idea that dog foods have so much bad stuff in them.  Dogs are carnivores, so it makes sense that they have problems on a wheat and corn diet.  The vet didn't try to sell us any particular brand of food, he just suggested trying a wheat and corn free brand for a couple months to see how it goes.  We are trying Nutro Natural Choice now.<br /><br />Too bad.  $50-60/bag dog food for a Great Dane is going to add up.\n",

      "I bought this dog food because the bag showed pictured of veggies and chunks of meat, and with a name like \"Beneful\" I thought I was purchasing a nutritious brand of dog food. My dogs did eat this food, but after reading the ingredients I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my dogs. The first three ingredients are Ground yellow corn, chicken by-product meal, and corn gluten meal. How disgusting is that?! The main ingredient is a corn filler. One thing my vet told me a while back that I never forgot: \"When you eat corn, what comes out of the other end? The same thing happens with dogs.\" Basically, dogs cannot digest corn, it is just a filler and causes them to actually eat more to feel full, poop out more, and retain less nutrients. The only meat in Beneful at all is a by-product, its not even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product to anyone, for any reason, ever. It is an absolutely awful dog food. I can't believe the pictures of veggies and full chunks of meat on the bag can be allowed to be on the packaging of such a disgusting product; it is very misleading and should be considered false advertising.<br /><br />I recommend to stay far away from Beneful, and most Purina products. When purchasing a dog (or cat) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you would eat yourself. Now that I know what to look for, I usually buy my pets all natural, organic foods such as Blue Buffalo, Halo or Wellness.\n",

      "The primary problem with this food is it's high concentration of corn--cats are meat eaters and ideally most of their food should be meat. This food substitutes corn as a filler. Over half of this product is most likely corn filler. This is pretty standard for cat food at this price level. They also use the less preferred method of safety testing their product. The best thing is to do actual feed tests where in a laboratory they feed cats the food and see if it's nutritionally adequate or if it kills them. Instead this product is chemically analyzed in a laboratory and certified \"safe\" that way. This testing is inadequate and results in death for many people's pets. No evaluation is made of whether the food is digestible or not, if it is contaminated with poisons, toxins, or heavy metals. Chances are this food won't kill your cat, but since they stopped feed testing, there's no way to know if future batches are safe.<br /><br />The nicest things I can say:<br />The high filler means it firms up runny stools moderately well.<br />It's somewhat better nutritionally than most generic grocery store brands\n"

      "Few things I'd like to point out:<p>1.  &quot;Espresso&quot; is not a roast.  It's a drink.  In northern Italy they make espresso from Vienna roast, in southern Italy they use French.  Starbucks appears to be using French roast, so they should just label it French roast like any normal person would.<p>2.  The product description says &quot;Taste Espresso Roast as both a shot of espresso and brewed in a coffee press. This is one versatile coffee!&quot;  This is patently absurd.  It's pre-ground coffee, and it's either for use in espresso machines or presses, but not both.  Here's why:<p>Making a shot of espresso requires a very fine grind.  Making coffee press coffee requires a very course grind.  If you have ground coffee that is appropriate for espresso machines, it will pass through the filter in a coffee press and you will have a cup of sludge.  If you use ground coffee that does not pass through a press's filter in an espresso machine, you do not get espresso.  You get cafe crema, which is a good, but entirely different, beverage.<p>Therefore, a &quot;Universal Grind&quot; is an impossibility.  They should tell you on the label what kind of coffee maker it's ground for, like normal people.<p>3.  It's over-roasted.  Starbucks has an excellent bean-sourcing operation that buys better coffee than any other company of its size.  Then they roast all their beans Vienna or French.  Most beans taste best at a particular level of roasting that varies with the bean, and for most beans that level is not Vienna or French.  So why roast all your beans too dark?  I guess it's just easier that way.  Also, it lets them rename Vienna Roast as &quot;Starbucks Roast&quot; because the Austrians don't seem to care.<p>That said, this is still better than what you get in the supermarket - Starbucks specializes in coffee and sources much better beans than any of the companies that also make cheese, hot dogs, shampoo or cigarettes.<p>Anyway, if you really want some good coffee, do this:<p>Buy a grinder.  Nothing makes coffee lose flavor like keeping it around after grinding.  If you have a drip coffee machine, get a grinder with spinning blades; if you have something else like a press or vacuum pot, get a grinder with burrs.  If you have an espresso machine, get a very nice grinder with burrs.  Amazon has good deals on all three kinds, just do a search for 'coffee grinder'.  It's not that much money, and if you're somebody who's willing to pay for Starbucks you should invest in one.<p>Find a local coffee shop that roasts their own coffee and gives you the date it's roasted on.  Freshness matters!  Good beans don't taste nearly as good after they've been sitting around.<p>Ask the people at your local shop to tell you about the correct amount of beans to use.  Most people don't use the right amount.  If you don't use enough, your coffee comes out bitter, especially if you have a drip machine.  Not enough coffee means the beans you do have get too much exposure to hot water, which makes bitter coffee.\n",

      "Wilton's Black Sparkle Gel icing looks and tastes good, but the thick gel is difficult to apply evenly.  I used it on sugar cookies to make \"ladybug spots and antennae,\" which worked out fine, but the applicator and thickness of the icing made drawing fine lines (e.g., for piping ladybug \"heads\") very difficult.<br /><br />But the biggest drawback for me is that this icing does not dry quickly (I left my cookies on a cooling rack for 8 hours overnight, at which point the icing was still wet.  After putting the cookies in the oven for 10 minutes at 200 deg. F, and cooling them, the icing was less wet, but still tacky and not ready for bagging.)  I have since read from reviewers elsewhere that this icing takes 2 to 3 days to dry.  It would've been helpful to see this noted on the packaging.  I would not recommend this for decorating cookies; after 2 to 3 days for drying, your baked goods will have lost much of their freshness.\n",

      "The only good comment I can give on these treats is that my cat liked them when they were fresh, and they are really inexpensive! I can usually find these treats for under two dollars at the grocery or pet store, and even on occasion at the dollar store. As this treat proves, often with a low price, comes a cheap product.  It would be nice if these pounce treats had healthier ingredients, maybe some vitamins or a dental cleanser, but no, its just junk food and a long list of filler ingredients. They smell really gross to me but my cat seemed to enjoy them. My biggest reason for not liking this treat, aside from the terrible ingredients and smell, is the fact that it is soft and chewy and not crunchy texture. Soft treats reek havoc on pet teeth as the sticky particles just sit on their teeth and gums and just rot there. Crunchy treats at least crunch off and don't stick to their teeth- hopefully crunching off some tarter with it. For a really good dental product, I recommend Crunch N' Clean brand with DentaShield. Greenies brand doesn't have as many beneficial dental ingredients, but they are pretty good as well as they contain vitamins and a little bit of breath freshening ingredients in them, so they are much better than these. Any crunchy treat would be better than these. Even other Pounce varieties are MUCH better than these, such as the Tarter & Plaque control varieties. The Pounce Tarter & Plaque control are a bit more pricey, but still relatively inexpensive and they contain vitamins and are crunchy. Another strange thing about these treats is that the recommended daily allotment is 6-8 treats per day, which is just crazy to me. I only give my cats no more than 1-2 a day of these while I had them. I eventually threw them out as they got hard as rocks and my cats didn't like them anymore anyhow.<br /><br />Pros: cat approved taste while fresh; and very fair price<br />Cons: bad smell, lack of nutrition, terrible texture for teeth\n",

This product is basically a blend of peppers with a little sweetener added.  I find it kind of yucky.  I realize everyone has different tastes.  I wanted a salt substitute to sprinkle on a bowl of brown minute-rice, which I eat often.  This seasoning is not remotely as tasty as table salt, or as tasty as Onion salt.

I've got to drink some water.  I also tried it on rice 3 times earlier in the week.<br /><br />I'm a little irritated.  It doesn't deserve five 5-star reviews.  You can't sprinkle this all over buttered rice and get a nice tasting meal, like you can with Onion salt.

Sure technically you can give this product to your dog and if he eats peices it won't require surgery to remove.

The richness of proteins produced from the shaded leaves should be clearly evident on the palate and in aroma, but very mellow on the tongue. The difference that I find: Adagio gyokuro has a much thinner, less umami flavor for the same volume of tea leaves used, and it has the bitter aftertaste that is completely absent in the higher quality batch (which, in contrast, doesn't even have a bitter note if brewing at boiling water, which really shouldn't be done anyway). Dropping the water temperature or brewing time for the Adagio leaves doesn't do anything to prevent the bitter taste.<br /><br />Conclusion: bitter, un-rich tasting gyokuro. One star awarded above lowest rating for actually being gyokuro. Avoid.<br /><br />I'm going to have to find another brand of something else soon to replace what I'm running out of!\n",

      "I am a huge fan of Adagio teas and of their Rooibos tea and this was DISGUSTING. I was so disappointed. I was expecting a smooth, sweet, creamy treat and - well, yuck!<br /><br />It literally tastes like something your doctor gives you to drink before a colonoscopy or some sort of medical procedure involving a radioactive scan. I couldn't drink more than two sips of it and it turned me off from tea for a few days.<br /><br />Unless you are a hardcore fan of chocolate tea and Rooibos tea, skip it. I love tea and I love chocolate (I love both in an obsessive way- can't get enough of either) but they just don't go well.

      "I bought this dog food because the bag showed pictured of veggies and chunks of meat, and with a name like \"Beneful\" I thought I was purchasing a nutritious brand of dog food. My dogs did eat this food, but after reading the ingredients I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my dogs. The first three ingredients are Ground yellow corn, chicken by-product meal, and corn gluten meal. How disgusting is that?! The main ingredient is a corn filler. One thing my vet told me a while back that I never forgot: \"When you eat corn, what comes out of the other end? The same thing happens with dogs.\" Basically, dogs cannot digest corn, it is just a filler and causes them to actually eat more to feel full, poop out more, and retain less nutrients. The only meat in Beneful at all is a by-product, its not even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product to anyone, for any reason, ever. It is an absolutely awful dog food. I can't believe the pictures of veggies and full chunks of meat on the bag can be allowed to be on the packaging of such a disgusting product; it is very misleading and should be considered false advertising.<br /><br />I recommend to stay far away from Beneful, and most Purina products. When purchasing a dog (or cat) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you would eat yourself. Now that I know what to look for,  I usually buy my pets all natural, organic foods such as Blue Buffalo, Halo or Wellness.\n",

I wanted to start with just a 4-oz. tin of loose tea, but that size was sold out, so I sprang for the full pound bag. Note to self: Don't EVER do that again!<br /><br />Why do I hate this tea so much? Call me crazy or stodgy or whatever you like, but I believe that flavored tea should first and foremost taste like tea. You should know that you're drinking tea that has flavor added. This tea is completely overwhelmed by the hot cinnamon. It tastes exactly like drinking an Atomic Fireball. Exactly. I like Atomic Fireballs, but I don't want a tea that tastes like one.<br /><br />I've tried adding just a pinch of this Hot Cinnamon tea to unflavored tea, trying to find the right balance of cinnamon flavor to tea taste. I haven't found it yet. The hot cinnamon dominates everything that I've tried it with.<br /><br />I know that this blend appeals to a lot of people. Just look at the reviews. I'm not one of them.

I threw away the first 7-8 that formed these giant cracks in the water - and eventually just gave up and put two wrappers in the water at a time (rotating one by 90 degrees - so the cracks were in different directions).<br /><br />Please understand - they are not splitting because I was rough with them; or because I used something sharp to pick them up; or because I overstuffed them... they are splitting in the warm water.

But this is way, way worse than other sugar-free baked goods. I have had sugar-free chocolate cake and loved it. THIS mix is terrible. There are many reasons:<br /><br />- The batter is like a mousse, that just gets hard when it bakes. So it looks like crap because it doesn't smooth out as it bakes. Every spoon-mark is still there when you pull it out of the oven. It looks really weird. You could not serve it to company.<br />- The cooking time on the box (for the loaf pan) is ten minutes too long.<br />- There is no ginger taste, or cinnamon, nutmeg, or spice flavour in this \"ginger\" bread. It is flat and tasteless.<br />- The lack of other flavours allows the nasty aftertaste from the Sweet & Low(tm) to bloom with full force.<br />- The gingerbread is lacking in body, because it is as light and fluffy as a mousse. It is not helpful for dieters because it is not satisfying to eat because when you eat it, you feel like you haven't eaten anything. Strangely, this gingerbread mousse is also rubbery. Rubbery stiff mousse that dissolves in your mouth.<br /><br />The overall experience is like biting into a vaguely sweet sponge. Then it dissolves. And then the bitter chemical aftertaste kicks in.<br /><br />I have NO IDEA how a slice of this gingerbread could be 160 calories. There's nothing in it, it tastes nasty, and it is gross to chew on! You can have a gingerbread Pop Tart(tm) for 200 calories, or a bakery gingerbread cookie for 120 calories, and they are full of fat and sugar.

Tastes more like cooked leafy greens. I am beginning to believe that buying avocado oil online is probably not the best way to go. This is the second brand of avocado oil (also tried San Pietro Chilean Organic avocado oil) I've purchased and both have been horrible. Maybe manufacturers of these oils should be more honest in describing the tastes of these oils so that the consumer would know what to expect. If they say it should taste mild and buttery than that's what one expects. Not citrus-like or herbaceous like described by others consumers. Also, I've read that avocado oil can go rancid despite the date on the bottle. That if it smells and tastes odd then probably it's rancid or on its way there. I've come across lots of oils in my lifetime and never the tought of it being rancid has ever entered my mind. Probably because I've never really come across any until now. Maybe avocado oil is a far to delicate of an oil that needs to be stored and handled in a special manner which too many sellers don't know how to. Anyway, I think I would give some other oil a try.<br /><br />Note: This is a follow up to my review. I wouldn't do business with this company ever again.

It is vinegar based.  If you think you would enjoy dipping your nuggets in vinegar then you would like this.<br />In addition I was mailed expired BBQ sauce.  When I contacted Julia's Pantry about the fact that it was expired they accused me of confusing the lot number with the expiration date.  It clearly said August 1, 2011 on the lid.  They wanted me to mail it back to them.  If I could do that I wouldn't have ordered BBQ sauce online.  Not everyone can get to the post office.  What a complete waste of money and time.\n",

      "The package label looks different than this one but it says Mount Sterling Goat Milk Feta Greek Style. I USED TO buy lots of it because I loved it. It was nice and crumbly for salads and omelets and a bunch of other recipes. Flavoful with a long shelf life.<br />NOT ANY MORE.<br />I was surprised when I opened a package to crumble it into my salad and it wasn't crumbly. No different than any sliceable cheese. I figured it just a labeling mistake and returned it to the store. A while later, same thing and I returned it to the store. I dug down to the bottom of the heap and found the last 3 packages of REAL feta. You can even see the difference from the outside of the package. This is part of the description on their own website, \"This DRY,CRUMBLY cheese is excellent in dishes with vegetables\". The label picture is exactly the same as the one I buy (and I just looked again today).<br />I emailed Mount Sterling, politely explaing the situation. I figured they'd want to know. I received a curt reply telling me that I was welcome to return it to the store. Then about a month ago I decided to try once again, even though it still didn't look like feta through the package. I bought it anyway and it isn't nice crumbly feta so I returned it again. I have checked other cops and it is the same.<br />I like their cheeses including the raw milk chedder but I'll not be so likely to buy from a company<br />that doesn't care about either explaining or correcting a problem. It doesn't exactly make me trust the quality.<br />They may sell this feta now, but as soon as the buyers try to crumble it, they won't be buying any more. I am very disappointed, as I loved this cheese.\n",

      "I was very dissapointed in this product.  It was no more than 30% lean.  It shrunk.  It was so thinly sliced on some pieces that I couldn't even peel it away in tact.  Its flavor was unremarkable other than extreme bursts of salt here and there.  My wife dosen't want to use it for an ingredient in other dishes she uses bacon for.  I did give what was left to my dog and she seemd OK with it, but then she has been known to eat poop as well.<br />Sorry, just being honest.  I consume many brands and pounds of bacon.\n",

      "This tree was absolutely nothing as pictured. It has horrible qualities for bonsai, even as a place to start. The best part of my money spent was the unglazed pot I received. The tree was honestly healthy, albeit with a poor root system(very obviously grown from a cutting/air layer). It is just a horribly ugly thing with attempts of wiring that would have been best left off. It is about a foot and a half tall with a trunk diameter less than an inch. I could lop off the top half to start over, but the curve in the trunk is so dramatic there is nothing to do with it afterwards. I am attempting to make something out of it by rooting the branches and making an air layer out of the top half, which might have potential many years from now.<br /><br />Bottom line, don't buy from here, unless you want to pay $40 for a small pot and fire wood. You're better off going to your local department store and buying a juniper with a blind fold on.<br /><br />This would have 1 star but, as I said, the tree was technically in decent shape, as well as the pot.

Even fresh packs (I can tell because of the dates of promotions on the package they sometimes run) can sometimes taste stale.  This is because the flavor of the cinnamint lasts just a few minutes.

      "My bonsai seemed fine for about a week, and then it started dropping leaves, just like all the others'. Unlike everyone else who's posted here, I found out why. I watered and inspected the tree and found little (.5mm) silver mites running around in the soil-- lots of them.<br />I did a lot of research and then eventually took it to a local nursery where they said and my bonsai came with a nice little infestation of thrips palmi.<br />Thrips are a common glasshouse and factory nursery infestation that attack the roots of young plants. To an adult plant, thrips themselves do minimal damage even in large numbers but can stunt or warp growth by feeding on terminal shoots, the undersides of leaves, causing them to drop. Each of my dropped jade leaves had a small brown spot at the base where thrips had been feeding. The real danger from thrips is that they carry Watermelon silver mottle virus that makes your leaves turn silver and shrivel up.<br /><br />The reason the leaves start dropping is that thrips love the warm dry air of a house or apartment and the parasite population explodes when you house the plant indoors as advertised.<br /><br />Anyway, in summary, they mention they are the biggest US distributor of bonsai, and I believe them, 'cause my bonsai has the parasites to prove it!

Since I've read that the Fukien Tea may loose it's leaves, I've kept the soil moist and have been waiting for it to releaf. The small branches have become brittle, so there's not much hope.

      "I also received the wrong tree the first time.  The first tree came quickly but was also the Gardenia tree.  After contacting Amazon they reshipped the correct tree.  It came quickly and was packed properly.  Upon arrival the tree looked good, but it quickly changed.  I have, in the past, grown Bonsai trees with success.  They do require attention and proper watering as well as light and growing conditions.  Both trees came in ceramic pots that did not match the description.  They were different colors and different from the photos on the site.  The gardenia tree did loose most of its leaves, but had new growth somewhat quickly afterwards.  This review is about the tree that I ordered.  This Fukien Tea Tree started to loose all of its leaves and appeared to be in distress.  I kept it watered, gave it great morning and afternoon light and maintained the temp around 75 degrees.  After several weeks, the tree has lost almost all of its green growth.  I had an expert view the tree and this gentleman seemed to think that the soil that the tree was planted in was too dense and didn't allow for any oxygen to reach the roots.  He seemed to think that the Gardenia tree was ok, but not the Fukien Tea tree.  He didn't think that transplanting the tree this soon after receipt would help since these trees need time to adjust to their new surroundings.  Also mentioned in the directions that came with both trees.  He also noticed some fertilizer beads in the soil which to him might also might not be the \"ideal\" for the tree.  He recommends a water based food mixed in with the water a given to the tree weekly.<br /><br />I wonder if all of these \"conditions\" were done to the tree since they had to send it to me to correct their \"first\" error of the wrong tree.<br /><br />Even though I love Amazon, I would recommend to anyone considering purchasing a Bonsai tree to select one from a local source.  These local Bonsai retailers are more interested in helping you get a perfect tree and have more a vested interest in your success than Brussel's does.<br /><br />Not that $50 is that much more than a good bunch of flowers from a florist, you still expect your tree to live for years.\n",

Soil did not allow water to enter even after a complete soaking. So I packed the twig back into the box and the UPS guy came and took it away for free. Now I have to clean the hundreds of dead leaves off of my floor.\n",

      "I have many bonsai trees and am a true lover of the art of bonsai.  First things first, when I ordered this tree it arrived quickly but was literally frozen.  Needless to say the tree died within 2 days of arrival since frozen roots are bad for plants.  Amazon was fairly quick in sending out a new tree and thankfully the new tree arrived UNfrozen.<br /><br />However the disappointment didn't quite end.  I'd like to point out that the second tree is completely healthy and still thriving after 3 months of my care, so kudos to shipping a healthy tree.  However, anybody with an appreciation of the art of bonsai will be very disappointed by the training this tree received.  It looks more like it was completely untrained and just allowed to grow naturally.  This is antithetical to good bonsai and leads to a pretty ugly (read: normal/average) tree.  It's just way too ORDINARY.<br /><br />Another nice note, since I hate to leave on a sour note, is the pot the tree comes in.

Unfortunately,  this time I included \"Dave's Insanity Sauce\" which I had unwittingly bought for my husband who likes it hot.

Nearly ruined my entire weekend... On our last day in Monterey we found this little shop called Slow Burn (alas no longer open) which was packed to the brim with hot sauces from all over.. I would say there were at least 10 different bottles to sample. To my delight some actually had distinct flavor rather than just hotness and pain. My favorite was a little bottle that had a sombrero for a cap, (not sure the name) but yum! The owner explained to me why the Insanity Sauce caused me such pain.

I've had much hotter stuff here in Asia.<br /><br />If you claim that you can take hot sauce or are a chilli-head and say that something like this is too hot even for you, you really have no idea what true chilli-heat is because this sauce is really nowhere near as hot as what many claim it to be.  The taste of vinegar comes through a lot more than the heat or any other flavour.  And no, there was absolutely no burn coming out the toilet end as well.<br /><br />Bottom line:  this sauce has only a mild 5/10 heatkick rating by my personal standard. 2 slices of raw chilli-padi rolled around the tongue for 10 seconds is still hotter than this.

      "I am a big fan of Dave's Gourmet sauces and condiments, but not this one.  If I was just rating it as a mustard alone I would give it 3 stars for taste, 1 for value.  There are much better, brighter and fresher tasting mustards available at half the cost of this one.<br /><br />However, this is a Dave's Gourmet product and as such I am looking for not just a good mustard but but one that makes a good use of a variety of heat producing, tongue scorching peppers, like Serrano or maybe even Habanero.  What we get instead is a mediocre Dijon-style mustard spiced up with \"hot pepper extract\".  This is a commercial additive of pure (or close to pure) capsicum, which is used for riot control and to add heat to an otherwise bland product.  In my humble opinion hot pepper extract adds \"hotness\" without adding to the flavor.  Dave's has some great products, I just don't think that this is one of them.\n",

Though the candies were of different shape and color everything tasted the same with no similarity to the flavor of chocolate in any way.<br />It was truly a waste of money. You would be much better off in just buying a Hershey Bar from the grocery store, at least that tastes like chocolate and it isn't stale.\n",

      "I love hot sauces and I have quite a collection of them.  When I saw this product at an Austin hot sauce shop (the apply named \"Tears of Joy\") I snatched it up.  Of the 5 different sauces that I bought that day this was the first one that I opened.  I have to say that I am very disappointed.<br /><br />I am really not too sure why it tastes so bad to me.  Here is what the label says is in it:<br /><br />Purified water, soybean oil, jalapeno chilies, cane sugar, wine vinegar, fresh tomatillo, Wasabi Rhizome, salt, lime juice, cilantro, ginger, mustard powder, green tea leaf, vitamin C, garlic powder, onion powder, turmeric, citric acid and sodium eritobate.<br /><br />It could be the large amount of soybean oil but the sauce tastes dull and cloying.  I was hoping for that nasal-passage-clearing rush of Wasabi but I could barely delete it's flavor.  For a brand that has HEAT on the label it's too bad that there was none inside of the bottle.  The green tea leaf adds to the visual aspect of the condiment (with all of the floating bits of it and the cilantro) but not the taste.  I just could be me or the bottle that I purchased, but I don't like it and I regret buying it.\n",

      "We received these Omaha Steaks brand Coconut shrimp as a gift. I like coconut is some preparations (pina coladas, certain cookies), but I don't eat it as a snack. I enjoy the scent of natural coconut.<br /><br />Though these shrimp are edible, the coconut aroma and subsequent taste overpower anything else. Even from the oven, the only thing that I can smell is coconut. When eaten, they leave a strong aftertaste that for a while makes one wonder if by mistake you consumed a coconut-scented wax candle by mistake. This holds true even when drenched with cocktail sauce to try to drown out the coconut.<br /><br />I cannot imagine that the overpowering odor is natural coconut, which I find to be pleasant. One of the listed ingredients is \"Artificial Flavor,\" which likely means that Omaha Steaks attempted to \"enhance\" the flavor in some way. Unfortunately, I can't tolerate the resulting smell, which is an integral part of the perceived flavor when eaten.<br /><br />In short, if you're a huge coconut fan, or if your sense of smell is inoperative, then these might be for you. If you are an occasional consumer of coconut, then proceed with great caution.\n",

      "We received a flyer in the mail -- an assortment of foods, beef, pork, and these really awful stuffed sole with crab and scallops. Well, like a dummy, I bought the deal.<br />So, perhaps the truth on Omaha Steaks: The sole stuffed with scallops and crab is really a shread of sole stuffed with a paste which I am hesitant to describe. It is not good to eat.<br />When our package arrived, we selected two filets mignon, two sole stuffed with scallops and crab, and four potatoes au gratin. The potatoes were edible.<br />The beef tenderloin was too thin to grill, but we grilled it anyway. Awful. I have already commented on the sole.<br />Still angry 12 hours later (color me stupid does not sit well with me!) I re-read all the information Omaha Steaks had sent us -- and conformed my suspicion that no where do these people state the grade of beef they sell.<br />The quality of the sole stuffed with scallops and crab is perhaps compatable with a very cheap diner on the interstate -- \"Well, you are hungry. This is cheap. You thought it might be good/interesting\" OK/ We have all made those mistakes on a long road trip -- but to buy this kind of nasty food to serve at home  -- I don't think so.\n",

      "When my wife and I first decided to try Omaha Steaks (I don't know, perhaps we were bored) we didn't even consider what came in the package besides the steaks. When they first arrived I was honestly more interested in the package of dry ice than the measly 4oz bits of beef with so little marbling that they looked petri dish grown.  Also in the cooler were some small pork chops, white hotdogs, mini beef slider patties, potato nuggets, and two big balls of butter in little plastic bags. Upon closer inspections (actually we had to read the box) we discovered that there was actually seafood inside that butter.<br /><br />A few months later I decided to try one (I don't know, perhaps I was bored). My wife however was not interested in experimenting with me. Turns out in this instance (as is almost always the case) she was in the right. After placing the butter ball into the pan with the required 2 tbsp of water and placing into the oven, I waited the minimum thirty minutes. I peeked into the oven to find what looked like a steamed piece of sole sitting in a puddle of watered down butter. Protruding from one end was what looked like pre-chewed fish stick slime, and it was growing. I decided to give it a couple minutes, just to be on the safe side. Checking every two minutes I left it in the oven for the full forty minutes stated as the maximum time in the instructions.<br /><br />As I reluctantly pulled the Sole Stuffed with ........something out of the oven, I considered that HEY, maybe it will taste better than it looks.  The first bite I took was the \"stuffing\" smooshing out of one end of the sole. Sure enough, it was pre-chewed fish sticks! The texture was slime with an over powering flavor of flour and water. Yep, paste! I immediately abandoned the stuffing and attempted to eat the sole. As others have stated, the flavor was mild and nothing more than alright. The texture was rubbery with a baked on butter slime.<br /><br />Getting up from the table the only statement that came to mind was \"at least if someone we don't like crashes a dinner party we'll have something to feed them\".<br /><br />Honestly, you're better off buying fish sticks in your local grocer. At least they aren't pre-chewed.\n",

      "Not good at all!  Sorely disappointed - Fish was rubbery - \"stuffing\"<br /><br />w<br /><br />as gummy, garlicky and just plain bad.  Will not order ever again.  Further<br />where was the \"shrimp??\n",

      "We have had Omaha Steak products for years.<br />We have had stuffed sole (crab and shrimp) that was very nice and convenient.<br />This was awful. Not worth tasting. All we could taste was garlic. It was very buttery(?) on the outside and alittle rubbery.<br />Left a terrible, overwhelming after taste.<br />We will not even ask for a replacement, which Omaha is not very good at doing anyway.\n",
      "2848\n",
      "I finally decided to order a package deal knowing I could get stuffed sole (scallops and crabmeat) with steaks as well as various other things. Tried the steaks first and while I was disappointed with the size I do say they are way more properly portioned than what I usually get. They are quite thin and are okay at best but definitely not worth the money. Next we tried the potatoes au gratin and I liked that they were different than the sliced stuff in a casserole dish I remember having as a kid (never liked them before) but these were potato balls and while they looked really good they fell short of what I was expecting and my expectations were not that high. One of those deals where the first bite is pretty good and it just goes down hill from there ~ by the time I was done with the first one I didn't care to eat the second one. They seemed like processed frozen food rather than a gourmet type item. I had just always thought \"Ohama Steaks\" and figured for the price everything would be that of a high-end steakhouse in quality but it isn't even in the ball park of a high-end steakhouse.<br /><br />So... what has prompted me to finally write (I wasn't going to) was tonight I tried the stuffed sole. I had one a while back \"just to see\" and while it seemed really bland it was so-so, so I thought I'd prepare a side dish (my own mashed potatoes) with it this time and give it another shot. (I'm a nut for anything crab and scallop.) Being hungry I baked 2 of them. Again I was disappointed with how bland it was but when I started finding BONES in my mouth that was it. BOTH of them had little bones.<br /><br />It was obviously a waste of time and money and I don't even care about the rest of the food. I may try to see if I can give it away. I am simply not interested and having paid that much money for this stuff and it tasting like some cheap clearance item, not to mention the BONES!! That is just not acceptable to me. I'm glad it wasn't one of my kids eating it.\n",

      "Please do not take this review as a dare. Please heed its caution with the utmost of seriousness.<br /><br />If you come across a bag like this, do not open it. The consequences will be great, but I'll get to those later. As for proper disposal, do not let ANYONE see these, as they might be tempted into opening them, seeing the deceptive word \"cookie\" included in the title. You have two options, both of which require items that are difficult to obtain, but which are the only acceptable ways for destruction to ensure these ruinous abominations don't return as even worse creatures. The first is to find some thermite or a similar accelerant that can burn this at over 4000 degrees F. The second option is to use a rocket that can escape Earth's orbit; you must carefully calculate the route to the Sun so that these don't get slingshotted back to us (we cannot risk something like this).<br /><br />As for the consequences: If you've ever seen a Roland Emmerich film (Day After Tomorrow, Independence Day, 2012, Godzilla, etc.) you will recall shots of people running horrified from a central location, scrambling in all futility to escape inexplicable horrors. What I've discovered from months of digging and \"Deep Throat\" style meetings in shady parking garages is that Emmerich adds all of the special effects in post-production, but uses these very cookies as \"inspiration\" for the extras in his film. Finally, you'll understand why all of the lead actors are awful (even talented actors like John Cusack), but all of the extras provide incredibly convincing performances.<br /><br />Andrew Johnson is widely regarded the worst president in US history. Imagine his remains being fermented like sauerkraut, sealed in jars, and then put into a time capsule to be unveiled by this horrendous \"Joseph\" character over 100 years later. The festering stink will stick with you for months. It's as if a skunk mated with sin and the scent was diabolically baked into an innocent-looking cookie.<br /><br />The reason I'm giving it 2 stars instead of just 1 is that these cookies have given me the most amazing idea for a spec horror screenplay. My career as a Hollywood screenwriter will flourish due to these incomprehensibly awful monstrosities.\n",

Have you ever wanted to assault yours or your friends taste buds? Behold the compact way of doing so! Please keep in mind that a chaser of some type of liquid is a necessity when attempting to eat these. I unfortunately did not have any present and had to man up while trying to over come these dastardly doom disks. Speaking of which, after eating one of these I was compelled to the bathroom by some satanic calling from my belly. Upon making it there I vomited profusely. For the first time in my life, the taste of vomit was welcomed. On that note, these should never be allowed near anyone whom ever was or is bulimic or anorexic as it will give them ever more incentive to vomit.<br /><br />Did you know if you threw these out the window of your car you'd be ticketed for littering?

      "Warning: there is a significant differences between the regular Valentina reviewed here (a yellow background on the label) and the \"extra hot\" version (black background on the label).<br /><br />The regular variety of Valentina hot sauce is heavily laden with vinegar. Yet, if you like a lot of vinegar in your hot sauce, you might really like this one. It tastes very much like Frank's hot sauce or even the original Tabasco hot sauce (once diluted). Unless you like a heavy dose of vinegar, this variety is Not Recommended. But keep in mind that a lot of vinegar is what many Americans are used to and may actually prefer.<br /><br />The \"extra hot\" version is much better balanced in my view.  The vinegar is in the background and while this variety is a tiny bit hotter - it is far from being \"extra hot\".<br /><br />To tell the two versions apart - keep in mind that the regular variety has a light yellow background on the label while the so-called \"extra hot\" version has a black background on the label. In very small type, on the \"extra hot\" variety, you will see the words \"extra hot\" but that is easy to miss. Use the label background to tell the two versions apart.<br /><br />Make no mistake, the two versions of this sauce are worlds apart. The regular version has a heavy vinegar taste and the hotter version, which is not much hotter, is far better balanced in my view. See my review of the \"extra hot\" variety for more comments.\n",

This is actually the review that sold me on getting these. They do not taste like that either. I think the consistency is what sold these reviewers on the response that they give. I will admit that the consistency is fun, it's crumbly, and makes it seem more appealing, the flavor is in no way appealing to me.<br /><br />What these do taste like is a mix between powdered sugar and the faintest hint of peanut butter.

(As an aside, what on earth is the purpose of that orange juice, which exists in less quantity than the caramel color. )<br /><br />In other words, this concoction is apples, drenched in high-fructose corn syrup and regular corn syrup, with a few raisins.

This mixture is marinated in liquor - rum, brandy, sherry, apple jack, or whatever additional or alternative liquor you may enjoy.

The ingredients often are the same as most other dog foods, comprised of substances of the poorest quality, including ingredients that are not even considered food.'Made with chicken' can mean as low as 3% chicken legally. Generally, only meats totally unable to be used for any other purpose at all are added to dog foods, and often includes feces, talons, feathers, hide, teeth, tumors and worse. Many of these poor grade and disgusting 'meats' are also then soaked in chemicals before being added to dog foods, the FDA's great idea to keep the meat  from actually being used in 'people' food--but I doubt you want your dog's food soaked in chemicals. People truly love their pets, and for some of us, it's all the family we have or certainly the ones that seem to understand us best. I'm working on a recipe that will work well for my dogs, human-grade. In days gone by, we raised our 'mutts' often on just left over table scraps and they flourished... because they were getting 'people grade' food. If you use canned dog food, smell the opened, refrigerated can on day 2,3 or 4--if it smells good, you will know. If not it's rancid--bad, spoiled, musty. We feed organic dog food now, not much more $$ but I don't 'trust' any of them,& try to make sure it's not from China or anywhere but the USA, and I keep an eye on ingredients and smell regularly, and I rotate. Even those with added supplements and vitamins may use those that are useless, poor quality that are not absorbed.<br />Manufacturers preserve with either synthetic or \"natural\" preservatives. Synthetic preservatives include butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), propyl gallate, propylene glycol (also used as a less-toxic version of automotive antifreeze), and ethoxyquin. There is little information documenting their toxicity, safety, interactions, or chronic use in pet foods that may be eaten every day for the life of the animal. Propylene glycol was banned in cat food because it causes anemia in cats, but it is still allowed in dog food.<br />Potentially cancer-causing agents such as BHT or BHA, and ethoxyquin is permitted at some levels. The use of these chemicals in pet foods has not been thoroughly studied, and long term build-up of these agents may ultimately be very harmful. July 1997 the FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine requested that manufacturers voluntarily reduce in half the maximum level of ethoxyquin by half. Some pet food critics and veterinarians believe that ethoxyquin is a major cause of disease, skin problems, and infertility in dogs. Hey, who loves my pets more, me or these companies? Hmmm?\n",

I NEED GOOD coffee, especially my first cup of the day. If I don't have that good coffee experience, I trash the offending beans and move on until the beans I find give me what I'm looking for. I found no aroma or flavor with the coffee brewed from these beans. I went back to my regular provider for my beans. (they don't carry Kona which is why I was intrigued to try this offering) I've had 100% Kona many years ago and LOVED it, so it's not that I'm unfamiliar as to what I should be tasting. It's just that this brand did NOT \"knock my socks off\" and I was hopeful that it would.<br /><br />UPDATE: After my review, the President of Hawaii Coffee Roasters contacted me and offered a refund or a new bag. I left the choice up to him. I received a new bag and have to say that I had the 5-star experience that I had hoped for. I ended up having received a \"bad bag\" the first time around. While it is not my favorite varietal, it certainly gave me the coffee experience I was looking for with great richness, smoothness and flavor. I also give 5-stars to Hawaii Coffee Roasters and its' President for OUTSTANDING service.\n",

      "Maybe I am a taste disaster. I could not tell any difference between Kona and ordinary blend coffee.<br />I mostly drink Starbucks espresso or Starbucks Sumatra. Since I feel that Starbucks espresso tastes better than this product, I'd rather go back on Starbucks espresso.

      "Well, I have to stay that I was very disappointed in this coffee.  I typically buy whole bean coffee from a local company, and I gotta say that I really enjoy that moment when I break the seal on the bag, and get that rich coffee aroma.  So, always hearing that Kona coffee is the best in the world, I really expected a great experience from this - however that wasn't the case.<br /><br />When I opened the bag, there was virtually no coffee aroma.  I don't know if it's been sitting in a warehouse too long (expiration date on back was July 2011 - it's April 2011 as of this writing).  The vacuum seal seemed okay - no tears in the packaging; so I'm at a loss to explain why the coffee seemed 'stale' .  And after brewing my first pot, I gotta say it isn't a great cup of coffee.  At best, it's a mediocre cup of coffee.\n",

      "Relative luxury items that charge a premium are subject to a greater degree of discrimination on the basis of commanding margin substanailly higher than that of more mid-stream, value or bang for the buck items.  If you're going to spend $30 for a 16 oz bag of Coffee, the expectation is that the quality of the product is high to exceptional.  My personal opinion, and that of several office co-horts, was that the quality of this product did not match the price point.<br /><br />Our office purchased a Techni-Vorum Moccamaster, with a copper heating element,  for ideal brewing.  Bottled Culligan water was used to make the coffee.  Under such conditions, the sweet flavor of Kona shines.  This did not happen with this product.  The consensus in the office is that the beans were stale.<br /><br />One trick in the food industry to add margin is to sell products that are slightly aged, and a at least a little bit if not moderately on the way to expiration.  This is the model that Trader Joe's operates under.  The difference is with Trader Joes, you pay less for the product, so there is still some relative value in the purchase.<br /><br />Pure Speculation:  I do wonder if this is the case with this product.  Higher Margin Product not selling in recession, gets older, passed off at disproportionately high price point.  I can not know.  What I do know is that I will not be buying this again. Again, while my experiences with Kona with other lines have been outstanding, this particular product was stale.  Suggestions on other Kona lines appreciated.  I am willing to pay up for good beans.  If paying at this price point, the expectations are high.<br /><br />Did have better Luck with Caffe Britt, which while a darker roast, exceptional quality, and good value at the price point on Amazon.  Happy brewing.\n",

We made 60 baby themed cake pops and we needed these pens to draw the eyes, hair and cheeks on the \"babies.\"  My daughter and her friend were practically cursing these pens before the night was over.  The black marker held up a little better that the rest, but the other colors were not good at all.  They smeared everywhere after a while.  The tips were not the best.  It was almost like they could not handle the interaction with the chocolate.  They got the job done, but barely.

The vanilla taste just isn't there. It's great for adding the vanilla bean \"look\" to my recipes, but I found that even if I use a lot, I still can't achieve a good level of vanilla flavor. I used about 1/3 of the bottle for a frosting recipe but it still didn't have the vanilla flavor I was seeking. I had to add vanilla extract for that.<br /><br />I thought it would be thicker and have more vanilla beans in it, but it's about the consistency of maple syrup.

      "I have two little girls, ages 5 and 7, and for Easter this year, I decided that I wanted to get them a cute little bunny rabbit as a pet.  Well unfortunately for me, all the pet stores nearby were sold out, due to the popularity of rabbits at that time of year.  I had nearly given up on finding one, when I ran across this listing for fresh whole rabbits on amazon.com.  I wasn't sure what the first picture they showed was, but all the others were pictures of the kind of cute little bunny I wanted for my girls.  Maybe the first one was a rabbit just after it was born or something.  Seeing that the price was fairly reasonable, I ordered one.  I wasn't quite sure how they were going to get a live rabbit to me through the mail, but I figured \"hey, if anyone can do it, Amazon.com can\".<br /><br />When the package got to my house, I started to get a slight feeling that something wasn't right.  The box they had sent had no air-holes, and it was strangely cold to the touch.  But I figured that I didn't know anything about rabbits, so maybe that was normal.  Deciding to press on, I wrapped up the box and placed it under the Easter-tree in our living room (actually, it's just our old Christmas tree that I was too lazy to take out to the end of the driveway, but I won't tell if you don't).<br /><br />On Easter morning, my girls were up early, wanting to open their Easter present.  I sat on the couch, with my arm around my wife as they tore the paper off the package.  Eagerly awaiting their cries of happiness, I was startled when instead I heard screams of fear and horror.  The youngest was screaming that someone killed the Easter bunny, and the oldest barely made it to the bathroom in time to vomit.  As I looked in the box, expecting to see that maybe the poor rabbit had accidentally died, I saw instead, a rabbit carcass, gutted and skinned.<br /><br />Thinking that someone had played a horrible joke on our family, I immediately called Amazon.com to explain what had happened.  When I finally got done explaining our situation, the lady on the phone told me that the rabbits were supposed to be dead, they were meat rabbits, for eating.<br /><br />This is perhaps something that should be explicitly written in the description of the product on Amazon's website.  My daughters were incredibly traumatized by the situation, and are now undergoing counseling (at a rate of $200/hour) to help them deal with what they saw.  I shudder to think of what Easter will be like next year.<br /><br />So in short, it needs to be said in the product description that these rabbits are DEAD, and they are for eating.  Don't make the same mistake I did.\n",

Of course I had been wearing my 3 Wolf Moon T-shirt for about 3 weeks (Still had another week before it needed to be washed) and the pack was hungry. They proceeded to claw and bite at the Whole Rabbit. I was an innocent bystander as the wolves mauled at my own torso trying to get to that waskally wabbit torso I held in my hands.<br /><br />There was no way I wanted to give it up as my wife has a great recipe she found on Amazon. The ingredients, to name a few, are; Tuscan Milk (naturally), Uranium Ore, and Twinkies. Anyways, the Whole Rabbit never got cooked, I ended up with scars about the head, neck, chest, back, stomach, and face. But worst of all, my beloved 3WM t-shirt is in utter ruins (at least they got fed).<br /><br />I can't afford to buy another one because of all the hospital bills, does anyone want to donate a 3WM to me?

Roving bands of rogue rabbits have remained armed since their defeat of the Venusians, and `wilding' by rabbit gangs has made New York's Central Park unsafe at all hours of day and night.  A radical Whig splinter group, led by the mysterious rabbit who calls himself Lucky Lepus, has even been calling for armed revolt in pursuit of a separate, nuclear, Rabbit Republic.<br />If we know what's good for us, we will put down the butcher's knife and make peaceful accommodation with the rabbits while it is still possible.

      "When the mailman came, I ran excitedly out to meet him in the yard.  Clad only in my fluffy lavendar slippers and a floral nightcoat...I am sure I was a ghastly sight...but I just couldnt wait one extra moment to finally get my hands on that rabbit!  I was so excited...whole fresh rabbit.  The glory of the purchase was stamped \"fresh\" all over the box in bright red ink, and the entire thing was wrapped in barbed wire.  \"Interesting packaging\", I thought...then thoughtlessly put my ponderings aside and brought my prize into the house.<br />  In truth, I nearly stumbled over the welcome mat as I hurried into the house with my extra special Amazon delivery!  Rabbit!  All mine!  How wonderful!  I hadnt had rabbit in years!<br />  With much ceremony, I sat down with a box cutter and began to open the box. Then suddenly this hairless, headless beast came flying out as if propelled by a spring.  It immediately landed on the table, and held up one of its forelegs. Although it no longer had paws, I got the distinct impression that the rabbit was flipping me off!  The irreverant beast was clear in its defiance.  Startled, I stepped back...I didnt quite know how to handle the situation.  I was quite frozen in shock.  The rabbit deftly kicked the box off the table and approached me with a confident swagger.  It seemed to be sizing me up.<br />  The next thing I knew, the rabbit had seized the box cutter from my trembling hand.  It weilded the blade with obvious expertise, waving it menacingly in front of my face.  I found myself completely immobilized with fear...a wave of morbid awareness drifted over me. There was nowhere to run.  Nowhere at all...<br />  The rabbit quickly stretched its naked, spindly legs and leapt from the table.  Within moments, it began to hurriedly ransack the house.  It spray-painted graffiti chickens all over my livingroom wall.  It broke into my safe and stole jewels and money.  It sold drugs and began extorting money from my neighbor.  It took candy from babies.  It sassed its elders.  I even found it in bed with my husband.<br />  Despite my outrage, and efforts to trap the abhorrent creature, it quickly spread its attentions throughout the neighborhood...then, the city.  It terrorized every man, woman and child...it spared no one.<br />  In desperation, I contacted the vendor for a refund.  \"Oh hell no,\" the customer service man said.  \"You wanted a fresh rabbit...and thats what you got.  No refunds!\"<br />  Indeed, the rabbit was \"fresh\" and consequently recieved many outraged face slappings from local women. But I was desperate to be rid of the thing.  I found myself, desperate...alone...with nowhere to turn....  I wept bitter tears at the prospect of my fate and the humiliation I had endured as the rabbit effortlessly dismantled everything I valued in life. My back was against the wall...I had no choice but to fight.  The sound of my boots scraping upon the pavement of the sidewalk was comforting.  I was ready.  My jaw clenched and eyes squinted...I was pure courage.  I was armed.  On my belt I carried the weapons of my forefathers...a bubble pipe, a package of red vines, and a rubber mallet.  I was ready to destroy, or be destroyed...<br />  The rabbit saw me and seemed to sense my determination.  It had no head, but I sensed it sneering at me.  With a warbling screech, the rabbit attacked me. It flew to action, attempting to cripple me with a spinning back kick and a flurry of karate chops.  Gasping, I lashed back with my mallet, blowing my bubble pipe fiercely, and landed a hit soundly on the rabbits side.  Before it could recover, I began lashing it with the red vines, leaving bloody welts on its pale, graying flesh. It squealed in pain and squirmed behind a trash can, with me in hot pursuit...<br />  The rabbit unexpectly turned, and I made a grab at the skinny carcass, but it sped past meIt cursed me and fled. With no head, paws or fur, the animal was very streamlined and as fast as greased lightning.  I doggedly pursued it to the edge of town when I lost sight of it...and I was relieved to see that the rabbit did not seem to be turning back.<br />  It seemed that as quickly as it began...the rabbit's rampage was over.  The last time I saw the beast, I had been patrolling the city.  I saw that it was armed with two automatic rifles and strings of ammunition, and it appeared Rambo-esque upon a hill.  It screamed \"Aaaaaahhhhhyaaaaaa!\" and fired the weapons into the air.  It then ran and jumped into a jeep with Charlie Sheen and sped away...<br />  I saw a mushroom cloud form in the distance...<br />  I looked into the sunset, my teeth gritted with determination.  I would survive.  And as god as my witness, I would never be hungry again!<br />  I sit my weary body behind my computer once again, mopping beads of cool sweat from my forehead. I begin write this review. Gingerly, I start to type....\"Yes, Virginia, this was a very bad rabbit....\"\n",

I purchased this rabbit for my daughter, as I thought it would be nice for her to have a more realistic toy than her current stuffed teddy bears and dolls.  To my astonishment, it began to smell very bad after only a few hours, and eventually degraded into a hard, wrinkly lump of brittle rabbit flesh.  Totally unsuitable for cuddling.  It is obvious that the manufacturer expects you to then buy another to replace it.  Well not this guy!  Once I have been burned I do not return to the flame for more.

In fact I venture to guess that's how its made with the bubbles that are there by some process of heat related fermentation.<br /><br />My experience in 1976 after ordering was regretting the 4 bucks just spent getting it, but I defend myself by saying I was so thirsty and hoping for a cold drink. Ha ha. I was later to realize that o get that kind of experience you had a better shot by freezing bottles of water in the US, putting in dry ice and hoping for a positive customs experience. That was a far, far better way to obtain a cool drink. At least in Vienne France if gave the nice inn keeper a twenty I got free use of a tiny fridge, which he found remarkably strange to use for my juice, colas or water. But that's off topic.<br /><br />Here's what you get for the almost four dollars per bottle, a weak watered slightly sweet beverage with a cross of what I hold is a mandarin and orange pulp, minor amount of pulp, some rather dingy looking stuff that's settled in the bottom that's grainy and a lot of off carbonated water. It's what my husband calls (poor word) water, but he likes them. For him they fill a sentimental niche. For me they say....France was very expensive.<br /><br />But I adored much about the travel and the country. I do like the bottles. I save them, peel off the labels and use them for rosemary in oil and other kinds of herbed oils I like to make. So if he'll drink it up, or I can pawn it off on some unaware visitor then I've got a nice bottle to use making bath oils.

Well, now I know.<br /><br />My first suspicion came when I saw that this slim package, just a few tablespoons, alleged to season five pounds (over 2 kg) of cabbage. I like big flavors, so I figured I'd just use more. Then, the first step in preparation wilts the cabbage by soaking it for a few hours in salt water - a process that left a strong salty flavor that won't rinse off. It took some effort to get the lumps out of the mix, when I added the water it calls for, and finally figured the small ones remaining would dissolve on their own. The final product is what counts, though - I just didn't like it. It doesn't have the tang I want, it does have a sweetness I don't look for in kimchee, the spicy flavor doesn't come across as fresh, and I just don't care for the taste.<br /><br />So, I'll try another kimchee mix if I find one.

The same thing happened this year - 2011, and I decided to measure exactly how bad they were.<br />I took an hour and the pot of pre-soaked beans and picked though them one by one.

Plenty of raw fruits (except banana) and vegetables (two raw carrots a day works wonders!)  Whole grains every day makes a big difference--I especially like brown rice and oatmeal. Apples are yummy: I eat one every day.  Eating beans and legumes is also very helpful.  Buy some dried lentils--they cook the fastest--and google some soup recipes.

      "I got my agar agar yesterday, and I feel like I've been scammed.  The only reason I chose to buy from Barry Farm was that it was the cheapest option.  But that wasn't the case.<br /><br />When I first held the package (which is smaller than what is pictured here), I thought it was oddly light for 4 oz.  So I weighed it on my military grade digital scale and bingo, it's 3.2 oz.  Without the packaging that would mean 3 oz.  I thought it might be my scale so I weighed my mineral makeup that came on the same day, 1.3 pounds each for a 1 pound bag.  So Barry Farm only shipped me 3 oz of product when I payed for 4 oz, which doesn't seem like a lot but when you do the calculations it's quite a dent.<br /><br />Let me compare this to the other agar option on Amazon by NOW Foods.<br /><br />Barry Farm (3 oz) $7.90 + $7.13 (Shipping) =  $15.03 (Comes in a plastic Ziploc bag)<br /><br />NOW Foods (2 oz) $4.20 + $5.38 (Shipping) = $9.58/2 = $4.79/oz * 3 = $14.37 for 3 oz (Comes in a plastic bottle)<br /><br />NOW Foods (32 oz) $40.79 + $7.55) = $48.34/32 = $1.51/oz *3 = $4.53<br /><br />So including shipping,<br /><br />Barry Farm $15.03/3 oz<br />NOW Foods  $14.37/3 oz<br />NOW Foods  $ 4.53/3 oz<br /><br />With a bottle instead of a plastic bag, my future purchases would be from NOW Foods.  I'm so tempted to get the 2 Pound bottle since an ounce is only $1.51 that way, but agar's gelling quality is so good that it gets used very slowly.<br /><br />Now about the agar.  I cooked it last night (1 Cup apple juice to 1/2 teaspoon powder), and left it in the fridge.  This morning I woke up to see it gelled quite nicely.  It doesn't have the doinky texture of gelatin jello and it's much harder to the touch.  I tasted it and didn't notice an exponential increase in the taste of apple juice, and the texture of the agar isn't as good as gelatin jello. It sort of just breaks apart in your mouth like...sand maybe? But at least it's supposedly healthy.<br /><br />So in terms of Barry Farms I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 star because at least the product worked.  But not going to buy from them again since I don't know if I'll be cheated.  Internets a scary place where merchant reputation is very important.  They should have put more product in the bag to ensure it measures at least 4 oz.  Now their reputation is tarnished.\n",

I had a few sips of it, and I thought it was going to be okay, but after about a half a cup I couldn't even finish it.  I threw the cup out and then I dumped out the remainder, after giving some to my roommate and she thought it was terrible too. The first sip is okay until the aftertaste hits you.  But the strong black pepper aftertaste is just overwhelming he can't taste the Chai at all.  This was a total waste of money.  Both the $3.85 for the Chai and the $2.95 for the Rice dream which fortunately was on sale.  Fortunately for me, I had some Oregon Chai still at home and another box of Rice dream that I could mix it with Chai was an out of luck entirely.  For me, I'll stick with Oregon Chai it has a much better flavor and no bitter aftertaste.  Plus, you can also get it in regular or in unsweetened in case you happen to be dieting.  If you get the unsweetened and mix it with Rice dream or almond dream that gives it plenty of sweetness on its own without the calories.<br /><br />I would never recommend this to anyone.

I reviewed the Ingredients listed on the jar and researched yeast extract and maltodextrin. There are very good articles on line, that explain how MSG can be \"hidden\", in the list of ingredients.  The articles indicate there are over 40 food ingredients besides \"monosodium glutamate\" that contain processed free glutamic acid (MSG). It appears that autolyzed yeast extract and maltodextrin are two of those food ingredients.  In addition, \"NO MSG ADDED\" does not mean that there is NO MSG in the product. If MSG is \"processed into\" a product as opposed to being \"poured into\" a product (just a matter of a different processing method), then a company can declare \"NO MSG ADDED\"  or \"NO ADDED MSG\", even though the product contains MSG.<br />Therefore, before I make an additional purchase,  I am asking Superior Touch --- Please advise if your Better Than Bouillon products actually contain any MSG.\n",

I know there are lots of good reviews for this product, but I thought is was terrible.<br /><br />Taste is a matter of taste.<br /><br />This cheese has a very tangy, sour, taste to it. Very uncharacteristic of cheddar cheese. When used on popcorn, the tangy-ness of it overrides the little cheese flavor of the product. It is a taste that is very inappropriate and uncharacteristic of cheese flavored popcorn. You are much better off just buying a quality bag of cheese popcorn. Also, it doesn't stick to the popcorn very well and half of the cheese is left in the bag.<br /><br />I decided to use this stuff to make mac and cheese. I made it very simple. Butter, milk, and this cheese product. With gentle prolonged heating, and cooking down the milk to thicken, the cheese melted very well. Creamy with no lumps. The tangy, sour taste, was overwhelming. I had to throw out the mac and cheese. At least I was able to eat the popcorn.<br /><br />I can't recommend this product.

It has yellow dyes in it and all the other chemicals and preservatives ...<br />Do yourself a favor spend the extra buck and buy the Hodgson Mill Wheat Mac And Cheese Dinner.

Their shipping is also outrageous but here is a tip with which I reluctantly part. Vitacost.com carries it by the case 12 bottles @ $4/btl. and has very cheap S/H-free over $75 and they have a broad line of nutritional supplements that you can easily add to cart to get total above $75 and get free shipping.<br /><br />If anyone knows of a quality ginger ale/beer distributor that offers free shipping, I'd love to know.

      "The rice itself is not bad at all. But there is nothing spectacular about it. This small bag of rice is not worth the price they charge for shipping. Only get it if you have free shipping (7.80 is alot). I thought it would have some type of slightly different taste being organic but whatever. There is not even a huge difference in the production of this brown rice and other short grain brown rices. I would suggest that unless the shipping price goes below $2.25, maybe if shipping was for about $2 with no more than $2.25 for the item, than it would be a nice price. Otherwise, look for a less expensive short grain brown rice because it will have the same health benefits for you and let you buy more with your money.<br />Basically, it's just rice and it is overpriced (suggest you search your local chinese markets or grocery stores a little harder for short grain brown rice, or find one with a better shipping cost).\n",

Both of them have their own unique qualities that are great in a cup of tea, Guayaki's Mate in it's own unique taste, and Peet's Masala Chai in its pungent and fragrant mix of spices and black tea.<br /><br />So, naturally, I thought that I'd like Chai Mate. Wow... was I in for a surprise. The resulting mixture was a disappointingly weak blend of Mate and other ingredients. Now, I believe a great cup of Chai to be one that you can smell from thirty feet away - and you absolutely will get that with a good correctly brewed cup of Peet's. Pour some cream into it, and the dark color of the tea blends with the cream into a delicious looking cup of tea. Or even enjoy it plain. Or just with sugar. And the same with Loose Yerba Mate, you know the taste, you want a strong cup of tea, and you want it's flavor.<br /><br />With Chai Mate, you get a weak tasting Mate taste and a insipid tasting Chai taste that overall smells way too healthy for Chai and way too weak for Mate. Overall these two don't mix - neither, incidentally, does cream... pour some of that into the tea and it will look watery, thin, and not very inviting.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor, buy the Traditional Loose Yerba Mate and then buy a tin of Peet's Masala Chai and have two cups of GREAT tasting tea, not one cup of bland, insipid, and watery tea.\n",

      "The Sun Bird Sweet and Sour mix packet I purchased had a recipe for sweet and sour pork on the back. I liked the idea. I also liked the relatively low sodium level for a mix. The instructions were printed in extremely small type, and I had no idea what I was getting into when I purchased the rest of the ingredients--pork, an onion, a green pepper and two carrots. I saw soy sauce, canned pineapple, catsup, cornstarch and sugar mentioned, but I always have those things on hand.<br /><br />By the time dinner was ready, I'd spend twenty minutes slicing, peeling and chopping, and had dirtied three bowls, two whisks, two measuring cups, a slotted spoon, a wooden spoon, a pair of tongs and my wok. I'd also used a LOT of cornstarch and another twenty minutes mixing the pork marinade (which called for 2 T of soy sauce, upping the sodium content considerably), mixing the sweet and sour sauce, marinating the pork, trying to brown the wet pork, removing the pork, adding the vegetables, adding the sauce back along with the pineapple, stirring frantically while the sauce was reducing and trying to judge when the sauce was thick enough. I was exhausted, the sink was full of dirty bowls and utensils and the kitchen was HOT.<br /><br />The chopping and the dirty wok go with the territory of Oriental cooking and I expected them, and I knew I'd have to make a pot of rice, but I certainly didn't expect to have to work so hard nor provide so many of the sauce ingredients to make dinner from a mix.  I wouldn't complain if the results had been spectacular, but they weren't.  Dinner was just OK. The finshed dish was bland and I added some red pepper flakes to perk it up. I must say I was disappointed both in the method and in the results. I've made sweet and sour pork from scratch before; it was only a little more work than this sauce packet recipe and the flavor was a lot better.<br /><br />It wasn't terrible, hence the two stars, but certainly not worth the time and effort.  I'll stir fry with orange juice and soy sauce before I'll use this mix again.  And in future, I'm going to read the back of packets much more carefully!\n",

      "On a recent trip to Holland I had the opportunity to experience<br />your excellent Senseo coffee.  I liked it so much that upon my return to<br />Seattle I immediately checked for the machine's availability in the<br />United States and was thrilled to find it at Amazon.com.  Last week I<br />bought the Senseo machine along with four boxes of medium roast<br />decaffeinated pods.  I also received one package of regular medium roast<br />and one package of mild roast with the Senseo machine. <p> To my horror all of the coffee I received is a very poor<br />substitute of the Douwe Egberts coffee I enjoyed so much in Holland.<br />The coffee that was delivered to me is weak and tasteless.  In fact, to<br />get halfway decent coffee I have to use two pods for one four-ounce cup.<br />This is unacceptable not only from the point of view of expense, it also<br />limits the use of the machine to one four-ounce serving at the time.  <p> I request that you provide Senseo coffee machine users here with<br />the same quality coffee you sell in Holland (at $16.99 for a four-pack<br />of pods it is more than twice as expensive here, which I'm willing to<br />pay only if the coffee is of the same superior quality).  Starbucks is a<br />huge success in this country because it sells real coffee, not some<br />watered-down version of the real thing.<p> Until I receive quality coffee to substitute for the poor coffee<br />I now have, I will tell my friends, neighbors, colleagues and anybody<br />else who might be interested not to invest in the Senseo machine.  In<br />the meantime I would be happy to return the coffee to you because I have<br />no use for it.  Please let me know when and how you expect to remedy<br />this situation.  If I do not hear from you within a week or so I will<br />return the Senseo machine and the remaining unused portion of the coffee<br />to Amazon.com for a full refund.<p> I look forward to hearing from you.\n",

      "Although I love the convenience of this coffee maker, I have been very disappointed by the flavor of the decaf coffee.  The coffee brews beautifully, creating an appealing frothy \"crema\" at the top.  However, the coffee itself is very bland.<br /><br />I keep hoping that Senseo will introduce a \"bold\" decaf option.  My husband, who drinks caffeinated coffee, quite enjoys their \"bold\" coffee pods.  In the meanwhile, I circumvent the problem by using two decaf coffee pods, while selecting the one cup option.  It concentrates the coffee, which significantly improves the flavor.  It bothers me, though, that I'm paying \"twice\" for one cup of coffee.<br /><br />From the reviews, it seems like a lot of people enjoy the decaf coffee, as it is.  However, if you enjoy a more intense, bold tasting coffee, you will need to use two pods to get some approximation of a distinct coffee flavor.\n",

Of course this also doubled the price making the deal not so good after all. Using two pods was a little too strong for my taste. Senseo rates the coffee as between mild and med. It was VERY, VERY mild!<br /><br />In all fairness to this product, I purchased these pods to use with my EZ-Cup in my Keurig.

      "Recently I ended up trying out the Senseo system, and I tried it with the Douwe Egberts medium roast pods. Normally I drink cold-brewed Toddy coffee, and even though I'm sensitive to bitterness and acid levels in coffee, I can drink that with just dairy, no sugar. I immediately needed quite a bit of sugar for this coffee--and then I had to start drinking half my usual amount of coffee. It was so bitter I almost couldn't drink it. It was so acidic it made my stomach hurt. And it was so caffeinated I got the shakes that first time.<br /><br />The problem was, I had no idea if this was a result of the Senseo process (the Toddy's cold-brew method does result in a less bitter, less acidic, less caffeinated coffee than normal) or the coffee brand. So, I ordered the EcoPad refillable pods (2 to a pack, very inexpensive) and tried it with the same coffee I use with the Toddy. It tasted slightly weak, oddly; however, it was enough for me to realize that the main problem was the Douwe Egberts coffee. If you really love the harsher Starbucks types of coffees, which I don't, I think you'll enjoy it. But if you have acid stomach problems or just don't like bitter coffee, I do not recommend using DE medium roast coffee pods with your Senseo.\n",

      "As someone who has been a fan of Ostrim products for the past five years, I have probably eaten 300-400 of these high protein snacks without incident. Unfortunately, this was not the case with my purchase in February of 2011. In an attempt to shave costs off of my high protein diet that can over 1,000 dollars for one person, I decided to purchase 60 Ostrim sticks (3 x 20) in regular, barbecue and teriyaki flavors. Since the expiration dates of these are generally a year into the future, I assumed that I could store the sticks for several weeks. I was dead wrong.<br /><br />After about four weeks of storing the sticks at room temperature, several of the shrink-wrapped air-tight sticks started inflating like balloons. This is a sign CO2 and methane being generated during decomposition. The inflated sticks were discarded and the few remaining that were still in their normal shrink-wrapped state were placed in a refrigerator.<br /><br />About a week later, I ate three refrigerated sticks just before heading to a venue for which I purchased tickets. This enabled me to get an exact timeline of the events, which are chronicled below. Suffice it to say, about four hours after eating three of the refrigerated sticks, I became deathly ill. I am 99% certain the Ostrim sticks were the source of the food poisoning due to the highly controlled, high protein diet at the time where every food, calorie, and gram of protein was being monitored.<br /><br />The symptoms were so severe, I thought about going to the hospital. My girlfriend at the time was a physician who was able to provide some assurance that the issue was not life threatening.

I sent an email to Hoosier Farms to make sure that was correct before dering becuase it was a really good deal and I waited until the next day but did not get a personal response.<br /><br />The following day after I sent the email I decided to go ahead and order this and I then saw that the price had increased to 10.22 with a unit price of .053229 but the description was unchanged, still had 12 boxes (16oz).  So I placed my order.<br /><br />I received my shipment last night and I only received 1 box of 16oz oat bran and then when I logged onto my account and checked I see that the decription had been changed to state it was for only one box with a unit price of 10.22.<br /><br />I will be returning this box ASAP since I can buy this same product locally for half the price.<br /><br />Bad, bad business practices. I will leave a bad review for Hoosier Farms everywhere I can.  If they had personally responded to my original email this could have been avoided\n",

      "I was very happy to find this product as I've been wanting to try buckwheat flour. The packaging states that it is naturally gluten free and that buckwheat is the only ingredient. However, if you go to the website for Hodgson Mill and look up Buckwheat Flour, you'll find an extra note that they don't bother to put on the box. \"Not produced on dedicated equipment.\" Translated: Probably contaminated. My advice, especially for those of us who are super sensitive? Take the time to find truly gluten free Buckwheat Flour from someone else.<br /><br />I've written to Hodgson Mills about their practice, so perhaps one day they will change things.<br /><br />In the meantime, there are companies that produce Buckwheat Flour specifically labeled Gluten Free, and I'll definitely be looking for one of them the next time I visit a gluten-free friendly store.\n",

      "I own an Illy x6 and it came with a sampler of illy ese pods. When those ran out I researched online and ordered these pods. First of all the pod is not tightly packed and has a looseness which makes the fit in the holder improper. As a result sometimes the illy machine keeps on going and overflows the normal quantity which an espresso cup would hold.<br /><br />Secondly the flavor body and aroma are diffuse and not good for espresso. If you are making a cappuccino you will likely not taste much difference. I do not recommend Lavazza for espresso on an illy machine.\n",

Earlier this week, a patient told me that she found a soup stock that didn't have any msg in it. I asked her to bring it in this is what is included in the ingredients:  Hydrolyzed (corn and wheat gluten, soy) Proteins, and Yeast Extract.<br /><br />Sure they don't put Monosodium Glutamate in their concoction, but hydrolyzed proteins and yeast extracts contain high levels of free glutamates. This is the same stuff that can cause headaches, muscle contractions, chest pain, mood swings, and insomnia in many people. The Truth in Labeling people have been arguing about this for years.  If you look at the picture, there is a asterisk next to \"No Added MSG*\". In the fine print they say: \"*Other than that which naturally occurs in the hydrolyzed proteins and yeast extract\".  The truth is they put this crap in there to increase the glutamate content.<br /><br />So while I recommend that we all eliminate our intake of MSG, those of you that are already doing so, don't get duped by the labeling.<br /><br />For more information see <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0929173309\">In Bad Taste: The Msg Symptom Complex : How Monosodium Glutamate Is a Major Cause of Treatable and Preventable Illnesses, Such As Headaches, Asthma, Epilepsy, heart</a><br /><br />and: <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0929173252\">Excitotoxins: The Taste That Kills</a><br />this review was originally posted on my website.\n",

Here is why:<br />(a) Two of the five reviews online said the cake could last 3 months, so I bought 4 cakes in one order.  Guess what, all four I got had an expiration date 2 weeks later.  Maybe I am just that lucky one who got the cakes just before they expired.<br />(b) Tiramisu I've had in restaurants has been moist and NOT very sweet.  This cake is dry and very sweet (comparable to cakes in Walmart).  The dryness may be due to the fact it is close to its expiration date.<br />(c) The cakes arrived upside down.  I opened one and part of it stuck to the cover.  This may have nothing to do with the seller, instead, buying cake online and getting it shipped to you may not be a good idea after all.\n",

      "Bought these to replace some old shells.  They were in worse condition than my old used ones.  So brittle and most broke with the first use. Unless making it for 2 people you'll need more more than a dozen to serve.  Also, If only making it for 2 people, how do you find a can of snails with only 12?  I find they always come in 20-24 quantities.  The ones that do come in 12 count are GIANT snails (read: way too large to fit in these shells, you'd have to halve the snail to fit, leaving you with 24 snails) So either buy multiple bags of crappy shells, throw away half your can of snails, or serve it 2 days in a row.  None of which I'd recommend. I found the shell size to be small, I enjoy a large shell that can hold lots of butter. Mmmmmm<br /><br />I would recommend these if you are a 1 time shell use person, but honestly who does that!. They are cheap and will last you a setting or 2.

      "First the good news: These groats have great flavor -- rich, nutty, slightly fruity, and just a little sweet. For many years, I have been eating steel cut oats, mostly from Honeyville Farms. (See: <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006ZN4XY\">Steel Cut Oats CAN, 4.38 lb.</a>.) Steel cut oats are so much better than smashed oatmeal and groats are even better. I don't know if these groats are a different variety of oats or if it's just that they are whole groats, but the flavor is distinctly different from the steel cut. I love the steel cut, so this is not to denigrate them, but these groats have a much more complex flavor that I really like.<br /><br />The bad news, which I hope only pertains to this supplier, is the number of husks. Sometimes it's only 1-2/bowl. Sometimes it 1-2 in every spoonful. There is also something gritty from time to time. This really detracts from enjoying the rich, nutty flavor.<br /><br />Groats require a lot more cooking than steel cut and they absorb at least twice as much water. My cooking method for steel cut is to bring them to a boil in a 2:1 water:oats mixture and then leave in the frig overnight. That barely gets is started with groats.<br /><br />So far, the best method I have found is to simmer them in a 4:1 (water:groats) mixture for about 30-45 minutes or until almost all of the water is absorbed or gone. I use the microwave with 1/2 to 3/4 cup groats and 4x the water. I bring it to a boil and then simmer on low power. I usually set it for 30 minutes and then check. When almost all of the water is gone, I put them in the frig overnight (covered). Sometimes they are too dry the next day. I'm still experimenting with the details. I like the microwave because I don't have to be right there to make sure it doesn't go dry and burn. And if it sits a little while, that just continues the softening process.<br /><br />I tried cooking them in my rice cooker (<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G30ESY\">Zojirushi NS-LAC05 Micom 3-Cup Rice Cooker and Warmer, Stainless Steel</a>). I used one scoop of groats (~3/4 cup) and, based on the results above, filled the pan to the 2-scoop level (double the amount of water). I set it to be ready at 8:30 the next morning. When I woke up, the house had a nice aroma of something cooking. It was a little like when I cook rice and a little like peanuts. Pleasant. When I opened the rice cooker, I found that the groats had expanded more than with the other methods. I added milk (half and half) and raisins and reheated in the microwave. The oatmeal was just about perfect. The groats had expanded to at least 2-3 times original size and were tender and soft, but still much more chewy than the steel cut. The yield was about 1.5-2.0 cups. Absolutely delicious, very filling, and completely different from steel cut oats.<br /><br />Now for the bad news. This really messed up the rice cooker. It cooked overnight, so I was not there so watch it, but I imagine that it bubbled up through the steam vent in the top. There was dried (cooked on) oat residue on the roof of the cooker and all inside the lid. I had to take it apart to clean it - about an hour. Do NOT try this at home. ;-)<br /><br />I imagine a slow cooker would work better, but I don't have one to try.<br /><br />I also want to try Moon Glough's suggestion of toasting them first.<br /><br />I also tried putting them in the food processor just to compare that with the steel cut. I tried several times with varying amounts of processing from just barely to almost a powder. They all came out like mush and tasted bland. It's a puzzle to me why the taste should be so much different.<br /><br />I love the taste, but am rating this product only 2 stars because of the husks and grit. It takes away too much of the enjoyment and it is not attractive if you are not eating alone. I'm going to try groats from other suppliers, including Honeyville farms. I hope someone has better quality control.\n",

      "I am originally from Europe (Germany) and love Italian Cooking. After moving to the States, I have a hard time finding the ingredients that I was used to get easily there in the american grocery stores. If I can find them, they are overpriced and of inferior quality (parmigiano reggiano anyone ?). I often feel that people are knowingly tricked by the industry by product names which resemble the \"real product\", the best example would be olive oil.<br /><br />Happy of at least finding one of my favorite pasta brands (\"deCecco\"), I was looking for the San Marzano tomatoes which I was used to get at my local italian grocery store for 1.50 Euros (about 1.80 USD) a can (the acidity of most american canned tomatoes is too high, in my opinion).<br /><br />So far, I have only found this brand at the local grocery stores, and after reading the label, I was very suspicious about it - a San Marzano tomato, produced in USA ? I gave it a chance anyways, at last, they have a high price and they are still on the market, so they might have something going for them.<br /><br />After opening the can, I instantly saw that these can not be real San Marzano tomatoes - San Marzanos are long and thin and bittersweet (once you tried them, you will be able to tell), these are spherical and sweet and sour.<br /><br />I have used them in soup and pasta sauces so far, at least they seem to be a little better than the regular canned tomatoes in the grocery store, but it can not justify the price tag - in Europe I can get this quality for about a dollar.<br /><br />So if you are searching for a good canned tomato, keep on searching - these here might not taste all that bad, but they are not San Marzanos and they are expensive as well.\n",

We give a lot of these out to the kids in the neighborhood as presents.  Today we got another 4 from a Seller --- these 4 barrels had an expiration date of 2/25/12!!!<br /><br />The need to realize that taking old inventory just to get rid of it during the holiday rush doesn't really work --- it's going to be a long time before I order anything from them again...\n",

      "Not being a food chemist, I'm not sure what the deal is here with vegan and vegetarian \"meats.\"  I really like most veggie-based patties, \"chicken\" bits, and breakfast sausages.  However, the various \"brats\" that I so desperately want to grill are, for the most part, terrible.  And I don't just mean \"not meat-like.\"  I mean, they don't taste very good.<br /><br />The food chemists at the famous Monell Chemical Senses Center have, as I remember, \"hamburger in a vial.\"  That is, with your eyes closed, they can fool you into thinking there is a grilled hamburger in front of your face, when in reality it is a combination of chemicals they have isolated from this product.<br /><br />So how hard can it be to really simulate the flavor of bratwurst?<br /><br />In this case, it's jerky.  It kinda looks okay (needs more imperfections... lumps and bumps), has somewhat the same consistency (you gotta pull hard or break off a piece), and, as far as the \"original hickory pepper\" flavor, you can tell it has pepper.<br /><br />But that first bite made me think of those veggie brats.  Not a good association.<br /><br />I guess this just needs to be an acquired taste.  I do appreciate the effort... the vegan product, the non-GMO soy, and the low-fat (in this case, 0 grams of fat) product.<br /><br />But can't those Monell scientists work up a vial of \"jerky taste and smell?\"<br /><br />I'll be waiting.\n",

If you've ever had the real deal, homemade, this is NOT it.

There is no basket or even a cardboard tray to contain the items.

I would return it but it's getting too late to order something else.<br /><br />EDIT: I wrote Amazon customer services and told them I was disappointed with the item but wasn't going to return it because we'd went ahead and started eating it and it was getting too late to get something else. They wrote back within an hour and said they were crediting me for the basket. So five stars to Amazon for customer service! That's impressive and they have a loyal customer in me now.

Unfortunately, TWICE we discovered that the body lotion in the first shipment had been punctured andan 1/4 of the product ALREADY USED.<br /><br />In the second shipment, the body lotion AND the shower gel had been punctured and 1/4 used.<br /><br />This not only is a huge disappointment in quality control, but a hygienic issue. Frankly, it is disgusting to think that someone had dipped their fingers into body lotion and shower gel previously, and then nicely wrapped up the package as if nothing was wrong.<br /><br />I am extremely disappointed at 'Art of Appreciation's complete lack of Quality Control.

      "I ordered the mix and match 60 item pack that was on sale expecting to get a decent size package and a reasonable value. Instead I got snacks that were priced at .25 per package suitable for vending machine use and of less face value than the purchase price. Even Amazon's free shipping can't offset the overpricing and if you order direct from UTZ the shipping doubles that overpriced amount.<br />Definitely not worth the price particularly when local retailers sell the same brand product at 4-5 times the size for under a dollar.<br />This multipack is in my opinion just UTZ's way of maximizing unwarranted profits from unknowing online customers. Seriously, 'buy direct from us for double the price anywhere else' just doesn't work for me.<br />They have just informed me by email that they will stop putting in the marked packages - so you won't know what the retail value is of what you are buying.

      "I am on a strict gluten-free diet as I have gluten sensitivity. I started using this product, assuming it was gluten-free, as it is naturally and doesn't have any added ingredients. Well, after continually having problems when eating my baked goods and researching all of my products, I found my answer. This manufacturer produces many flours and they make it clear on their website that this product is not intended to be sold as gluten-free.<br /><br />Their statement is as follows:<br />\"Celiacs and those with a wheat intolerance on special diets can find rice flour, tapioca flour and even sweet potato flour which has been produced in dedicated, gluten free mills to prevent cross contamination.\"<br />[...]<br /><br />Any other products from this company are at risk of cross-contamination. So, I should have done my research, but I didn't understand the need to. The lesson here is that a product cannot be accepted as gluten-free unless labeled as such. This product is not so labeled and it caused me multiple repeated health problems. I hope this will save someone else from the same issues.\n",

      "I'm from the South, and one day my ma cooked some Zatairain's Red beans and rice. Mmmm, delicious. So, a few days ago I got this Mahatma mix. I don't like Mahatma's white rice, but I liked their Long and Wild Rice mix, and have had their yellow rice a few times, although it is sort of bland in large amounts. I wish I had gotten Zatarain's now, because this stuff was edible, but the spices in it are rank. It's almost a bitter taste. I tried a little bit with some hot sauce, and it was awful. I don't think anything can fix this rice. I sometimes mix pintos and basmati together, and that tastes better than this. Although, one time I mixed black beans and basmati, along with some other things and that was worse than this, so this isn't the worst rice I've ever had, but it is the worst mix.<br />I'd recommend going with one of these instead:<br />ø Mahatma Long/Wild Rice mix<br />ø Lipton mixes(I like Herb/Butter and Long/Wild the best)<br />ø Zatarains Red Beans and Rice\n",

Don't expect cheesy popcorn because you won't get it with this seasoning.<br /><br />It doesn't cling to the popcorn very well either, which further diminishes the flavor.  You'll need to prep the popcorn by popping in oil or by pouring butter on after you air-pop the popcorn.<br /><br />Oh well.  The search to make air-popped popcorn tasty goes on, because this product ain't it.<br /><br />That said, the flavor is pretty good, but as previously mentioned, I can't taste it unless I use way more than the recommended serving size, which then defeats the low-calorie benefit.
